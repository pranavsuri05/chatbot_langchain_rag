BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer\\nservices related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a\\nglobal network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the\\nwidespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and\\nmanufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership\\nfor our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise,\\nvertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as\\nsales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-\\nwarranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation\\nand storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related\\nservices and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we\\ndesigned for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform\\nwith seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and\\nModel X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we\\nentered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to\\naddress additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) Capability features, battery cell\\nand other technologies.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through\\nchannel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial,\\nutility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater\\ncapacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of\\nmarkets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy Offerings\\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (“PPA”)\\narrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and\\nadequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel\\ncustomers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on\\nnew homes.\\nTechnology\\nAutomotive\\nBattery and Powertrain\\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the\\nunique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective\\nwhile withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction\\nand performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased\\nperformance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-\\nion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower\\ncosts, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles\\noptimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software,\\nincluding most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the\\ndriver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most\\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle\\nsystems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the\\ndesign of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics\\nenables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also\\ndeveloped software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our\\nsolar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate\\nwith Powerwall.\\nDesign and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our\\nteam has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product\\ndevelopment time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method\\nto integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost\\ncharacteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular\\nmarkets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the\\nareas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and\\nstorage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery\\nline is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products,\\nsolar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our\\npublic narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as\\nnecessary.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect Sales\\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have\\ngalleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure\\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more\\naffordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales\\nof vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nUsed Vehicle Sales\\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of\\na new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third\\nparties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-\\nlocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically\\nplaced along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In\\nNovember 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s\\ntransition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging\\nStandard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone\\nand advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced\\ntheir adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no\\nlater than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our\\nnetwork of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\\ncharging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\\nIn-App Upgrades\\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the\\nTesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a\\nsubscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\\nchannels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial\\ncustomers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt\\nclean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nService\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work\\nremotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and\\nimprovements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and\\nremedy many problems remotely and proactively.\\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may include limited\\nwarranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer optional extended service plans that\\nprovide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally provide manufacturer’s\\nlimited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the\\nsystem. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship.\\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we also\\nprovide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable\\nmanufacturers’ warranties.\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that commit that the\\nunderlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in the contract.\\nFinancial Services\\nAutomotive\\nPurchase Financing and Leases\\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia ourselves and\\nthrough various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may\\nobligate us to cover a resale loss up to a certain limit or repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.\\nInsurance\\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other\\nalternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer\\ninsurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or\\nintegrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of\\nelectricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,\\nGigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain\\nvehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows\\nus to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the\\nimpact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand\\nproduction capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding\\nlocal manufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with\\nvendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or\\nare similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple\\nsources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize\\npotential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks\\nfor components with lengthy procurement lead times.\\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by\\nmarket conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to\\nexecute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to\\nraw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and\\nproducts are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nPrograms and Incentives\\nInflation Reduction Act\\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December\\n31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and\\nenergy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up\\nto $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel\\neconomy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\\nrequirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms\\nat the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits\\ndescribed below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale\\nenergy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy\\nstorage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these\\nprograms. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a\\ncomponent of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax\\ncredit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems\\nthey purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently\\nscheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy\\nand to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or\\nresidential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where\\nwe own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are\\ncurrently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\nRegulations\\nVehicle Safety and Testing\\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal\\nMotor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and\\noccupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable\\nFMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles\\nmeet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft\\nPrevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements\\nregarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes\\ninvolving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety\\ninvestigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain\\ninformation regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel\\neconomy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car\\nAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those\\nregulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the\\nrollout of new vehicle features.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs\\nthat we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has\\npublished recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to\\ninvestigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have\\nlegal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory\\npatchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some requirements restrict the\\ndesign of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and\\nproposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S.\\nand ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.\\n10\\nTable of Contents\\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers\\nand dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile\\nmanufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform\\nwarranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.\\nIn certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative\\nprocesses to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively\\nlobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our\\nown retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-\\nion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.\\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery\\npacks are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have\\nagreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\\nSolar Energy—General\\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our\\nsystems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties,\\nsuch as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to\\ninterconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated\\nby their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available\\nunder net metering or have proposed to do so.\\nCompetition\\nAutomotive\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and\\ngrowing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the\\nelectric vehicle market.\\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For\\nexample, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3\\nand Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically\\ninclude internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers\\nhave entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and\\nvehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle\\nmarket by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have\\nelectric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are\\nalso developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\\n11\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions\\nand other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural\\nnetwork capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Systems\\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are\\nsimilar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density\\nand efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage\\nproducts give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We\\ncompete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our\\nsolar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies\\nonly install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with\\nour offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio.\\nAs part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents,\\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure\\nagreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest\\npossible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and\\ndefend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for\\ninfringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this\\npledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other\\ncompanies making electric vehicles and the world.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\\nESG\\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon\\nemissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation\\necosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one,\\nincluding with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing\\nsustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that\\nensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing\\ninto their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the\\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and\\nexternal stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our\\nincidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling,\\nimpactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a\\ngovernance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent\\nwith high principles of business ethics. Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of leaders from across our company, and regularly presents to our Board\\nof Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.\\nHuman Capital Resources\\nA competitive edge for Tesla is its ability to attract and retain high quality employees. During the past year, Tesla made substantial investments in\\nits workforce, further strengthening its standing as one of the most desirable and innovative companies to work for. As of December 31, 2023, our\\nemployee headcount worldwide was 140,473.\\nWe have created an environment that fosters growth opportunities, and as of this report, nearly two-thirds (65%) of our managers were promoted\\nfrom an internal, non-manager position, and 43% of our management employees have been with Tesla for more than five years. Tesla’s growth of 35%\\nover the past two years has offered internal career development to our employees as well as the ability to make a meaningful contribution to a\\nsustainable future.\\nWe are able to retain our employees, in part, not only because employees can enjoy ownership in Tesla through stock (of which 89% have been\\ngiven the opportunity to), but because we also provide them with excellent health benefits such as free counseling, paid parental leave, paid time off and\\nzero-premium medical plan options that are made available on the first day of employment.\\nWe recognize the positive impact that leaders can have on their teams and offer fundamental skills training and continuous development to all\\nleaders through various programs globally.\\nWe don’t stop there.

RISK FACTORS\\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently\\nknown to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control\\nour manufacturing costs.\\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example,\\nwe encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and\\nwith ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique\\nmanufacturing processes and design features for our products. As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will\\nbe able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need\\nto implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances,\\nhigh quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as\\nMexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such\\nas those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve\\nmanufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our\\nproduct ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and\\nSolar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter\\ndelays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.\\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of\\nour future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we\\nmay be unable to manage these components effectively.\\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to\\nmultiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material\\ncosts, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port\\ncongestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to\\nremain solvent and operational. For example, a global shortage of semiconductors beginning in early 2021 has caused challenges in the manufacturing\\nindustry and impacted our supply chain and production. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if\\nthey are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and\\nrequire us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities,\\nproduct design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity\\nexpansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes\\nby us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may\\nface suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or\\nrequire us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may\\nexperience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure\\nadditional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly\\nor at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid\\nunfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce,\\nespecially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\\nresults.\\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high\\nvolumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of\\ncomponent purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the\\nincreased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off\\ncosts, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may\\nexperience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and\\nworkforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and\\ncommencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nto a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and\\nmaintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and\\nretention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality\\nunits at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally\\nintend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays\\nin meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement\\niterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating\\nand maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging\\nnetworks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range\\nof potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous\\ninternational variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to\\ntimely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a\\ngiven region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast\\ndemand in various markets.\\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production\\nvolumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets\\nrequiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and\\ntouchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we\\nare working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized\\nprofessionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability\\nof our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts\\ninventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and\\nconnectors throughout the world.\\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets\\nglobally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure\\nnetwork will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that\\nthey will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to\\nsupport them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale,\\ninstallation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to\\nmanage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and manufacture of\\nour own cells, and control our related costs.\\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially\\nmore cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.\\nLimited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing\\nsuppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long\\nterm, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater\\nvolumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and\\nmay continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we\\nhave planned or at all. If we are\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at\\npotentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and\\navailability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be\\nunstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric\\nvehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be\\nwilling or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced\\navailability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot\\nrecoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth,\\nprospects and operating results.\\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an\\nautomotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in\\nparticular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles\\ncompete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively\\naffected by numerous factors, such as:\\n•\\nperceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\\n•\\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;\\n•\\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion\\nengine vehicles;\\n•\\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\\n•\\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\\n•\\nconcerns about our future viability.\\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets,\\nwhich may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer\\ndemand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and\\nattempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.\\nRising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and\\noperating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate\\nwith such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\\nmay be harmed.\\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A significant and growing\\nnumber of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market\\nfor electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology\\nand other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as\\nChina and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain\\ngovernment and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater\\nbenefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established\\nresources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased\\ncompetition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm\\nour business, financial condition and operating results.\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of\\ncompeting energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable\\nenergy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\\nRisks Related to Our Operations\\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the\\nproduction and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production,\\nincluding by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and\\npacks and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or\\nif we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be\\nlimited, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our\\nvarious facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety\\nprocedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations.\\nAny such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\\nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain\\nregulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous\\njurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our\\noperations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety\\nrequirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business\\nlocations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights;\\ntrade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products.\\nFor example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to\\nsell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to\\nbecome fully functional.\\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed\\nor intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD Capability features take longer than expected to\\nbecome enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be\\nharmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection\\nclaims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products’ capability and performance,\\nthere is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial\\nfunctional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues\\nwe observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy\\nour customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry,\\nwe currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance\\ncharacteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-\\nproduction and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to\\nor installation for customers.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our\\nvehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we\\nexpect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD\\nCapability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports\\nregarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and\\nregulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In\\naddition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain\\nby venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to\\npassively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our\\nvehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy\\nstorage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may\\nsubject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of\\nwhich may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product\\nliability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings\\nagencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited\\noperating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing,\\ndelivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services;\\nour quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In\\nparticular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of\\ncommentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the\\nsufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more\\ndifficult to raise additional funds if needed.\\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various\\nfinancing programs.\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions.\\nWe also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such\\narrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small\\nportion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various\\narrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or\\npurchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and\\nconsumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’\\nresidual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and\\ndemand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments\\nto our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our\\nvehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are\\nunable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs\\nare not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle\\nleasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nSimilarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such\\ncounterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values are subject to\\nfluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above. If the actual resale values of any\\nvehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial\\ncondition and operating results may be harmed.\\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In\\nthe event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations\\nto us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with\\nrespect to the underlying assets.\\nWe must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York\\nrelating to our Gigafactory New York.\\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”).\\nThese agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of\\nour Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved\\nfunctions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel\\nin the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and\\nother costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2023, we are currently in\\nexcess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo. While we expect to have and grow significant\\noperations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet\\nall applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the\\ntermination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\\nAny of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the\\ndevelopment, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of\\nTesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to\\nsuccessfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and\\nretain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to\\nsupport our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing\\nthese risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented\\nindividuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations,\\nparticularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including\\nspecialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and\\nprosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth\\nopportunities.\\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in\\norder to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for\\nfuture increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite\\nstockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire\\nqualified personnel may be harmed.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant\\ntime with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief\\nExecutive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chairman\\nand Chief Technical Officer of X Corp., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-\\nattacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory\\ninvestigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory\\nmanagement, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This\\nincludes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain\\ninformation technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-\\nattacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service\\nattacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns,\\ndamage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional\\nactions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or\\ndissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any\\nof these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time\\nconsuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness\\nof database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and\\nsecurity of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on\\nour business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management\\nsoftware provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems\\nhave not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption\\nto, our or our service providers’ systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third\\nparties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost,\\nand there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating\\ncurrent systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory,\\nprocure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain\\ncompliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to\\naccurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which\\nmay impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information,\\ncould be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we\\nexpect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in\\ndata connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security\\nmeasures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have\\nreportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain\\ncontrol of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our\\nproducts. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we\\naim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can\\nbe identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations.\\nIn addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in\\nthe perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been\\nthe subject of such reports in the past.\\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and\\nincreased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective\\nbargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently\\nto provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be\\nrequired to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which\\nsuch unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future.\\nAny unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are\\ndirectly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or\\nstrikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from\\nvarious hardware and software-related safety concerns or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing\\nof or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative\\npublic perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we\\nmay voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant\\nwith applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by\\nsystems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service\\nburdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with\\nrespect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us,\\nwe generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the\\nlife of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\\nguarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the\\ncontract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some\\ncases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease\\noperations or fail to honor their warranties.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be\\nharmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based\\non actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and\\nchanges to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to\\nproduce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us,\\nfor which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in\\nsome cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy\\nlimitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss\\nthat is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our\\nability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In\\naddition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to\\nchanges in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted.\\nFurthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to\\naccelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate\\nsubstantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or\\nthrough obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our\\ncurrent or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our\\nsignificant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be\\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of\\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may\\nchange periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in\\nengineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed\\nequipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed\\nequipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened,\\ncausing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur\\nadditional indebtedness.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt,\\nto the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our\\nvulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our\\nexisting and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or\\nrepurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future\\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash\\nflow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to\\nmake necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as\\nreducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous\\nor highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In\\naddition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not\\nbe able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our\\nfinancial condition and operating results.\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses\\nand localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such\\nforeign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically\\nexperienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be,\\ndenominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates\\nsignificantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins\\nwill suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be\\ntime-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business.\\nOur competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or\\ninterfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business.\\nFrom time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging\\ninfringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries,\\nmaking it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the\\nconfidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.\\nThe theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position.\\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in\\nthese circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are\\nstrategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into\\nlicensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\nlitigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to\\nhave or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making,\\nselling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license\\nroyalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we\\nare required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may result in\\nadditional costs or risks.\\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor\\nadvocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in\\nrecent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition\\nto sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur\\nadditional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics.\\nWe may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or\\nother events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern\\nCalifornia and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located\\nexperienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as\\nearthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our\\nheadquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition,\\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly\\nevery geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Also, the broader\\nconsequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts;\\nairspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against\\ncompanies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such\\nevents outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nRisks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the\\ndevelopment and adoption of such products.\\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax\\nexemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives\\nfavoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or\\nreinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended\\nto provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such\\ndevelopments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing\\nmodifications.\\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy\\nstorage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.\\nHowever, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase,\\nsometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy\\nthat their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been\\nor has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before\\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\\noperating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract\\ninvestment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair\\nmarket values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined\\nthat these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our\\nobligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.\\nWe are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes\\nupon our operations or products.\\nAs we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and\\nsafety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use,\\nhandling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with\\nrespect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could\\nalso lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and\\nany failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nincreased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government\\ninvestigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it\\nmay harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations\\napplicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries\\noutside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from\\nequivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries.\\nThis process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with\\nforeign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and\\npotentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to\\ndevelop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may\\nadversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including\\nfull self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to\\napply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork\\nof complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely\\naffect our business.\\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity\\ngenerated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual\\npower plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity\\npricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-\\nowned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance\\nor use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and\\nservices, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant\\njurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy,\\ndata protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable\\ninformation could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other\\nsignificant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an\\nunsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from\\nand defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and\\nmay require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or\\nattractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection\\nRegulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection\\nmeasures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing\\nfederal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on\\nour use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in\\nChina.\\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may\\ncause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal\\nliability.\\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to\\ncybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could\\ninclude ongoing audit requirements, data protection\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nauthority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other\\ncommercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be\\nrequired to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal\\ninformation of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and handle. A major breach of\\nour network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects\\nand operating results.\\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain\\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings.\\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has\\nconcluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility\\nthat we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any\\nother government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information\\nand subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our\\nvehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales\\nmodel. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such\\nassertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations\\nand others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such\\nresults have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers\\nanywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted,\\nwould prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability\\nto operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable\\nto our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may\\nrestrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and\\nmay change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm\\nour financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors,\\nsome of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $299.29 per share and a\\nlow of $152.37 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume\\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our\\ncommon stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common\\nstock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may\\nadditionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating\\nperformance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation\\nhas been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial\\ncosts and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we\\ncontinue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and\\nadding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce\\nexisting products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-\\nquarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied\\nupon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or\\ninvestors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially,\\neither suddenly or over time.\\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price\\nto decline.\\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting\\nbusiness conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past\\nbeen inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those\\nrelating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and\\ncommodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on\\nour financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\\nIf Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations,\\nor in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase\\nshares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings\\nand placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr.\\nMusk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of\\nTesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock\\nto decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to\\nsell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a\\ntakeover attempt.\\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an\\nacquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law\\nthat limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may\\nrequire us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and\\nterms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares\\nof our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNone.\\n28\\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in\\nItem 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees\\nor customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our\\nbusiness, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party\\nassessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we,\\namong other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration\\ntesting using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability\\nreporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer\\nproducts) and implement appropriate changes.\\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1)\\npreparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident\\nanalysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding\\nmatters of cybersecurity.\\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to\\ndetermine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with\\ntechnical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation\\nstrategies.\\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and\\ncompliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2023, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the\\nrequirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third\\nparties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated\\nwhen determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing\\nour employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity\\ncompromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have\\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the\\nheading “Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other\\nsecurity incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability,\\nreputational damage and other adverse consequences” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCybersecurity Governance\\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is\\nresponsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior\\nmanagement, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This\\nincludes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy\\nincidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on\\ncybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\\n29\\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance\\nand Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including\\nsecurity, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and\\nremediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes\\ndescribed above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.\\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1-\\nBusiness. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2022-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7.\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022, which was\\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 31, 2023.\\nOverview and 2023 Highlights\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully\\nelectric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance,\\nfinancial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence,\\nrobotics and automation.\\nIn 2023, we produced 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,808,581 consumer vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle\\nproduction, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and\\nlocalizing our supply chain, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new\\nproducts to market and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\\nIn 2023, we deployed 14.72 GWh of energy storage products and 223 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping\\nproduction of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy\\nsystems.\\nIn 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77 billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp\\nproduction, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in\\nresearch and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\\nIn 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44 billion, compared to the\\nprior year. This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. We continue\\nto focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.\\nWe ended 2023 with $29.09 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $6.91 billion from the end of 2022.\\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 and 2022 were $13.26 billion and $14.72 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.47\\nbillion. Capital expenditures amounted to $8.90 billion in 2023, compared to $7.16 billion in 2022, representing an increase of $1.74 billion. Sustained\\ngrowth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and\\ndevelopment in upcoming periods.\\n33\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\\nAutomotive—Production\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the\\ndate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\\nProduction Location\\nVehicle Model(s)\\nProduction Status\\nFremont Factory\\nModel S / Model X\\nActive\\n \\nModel 3 / Model Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Shanghai\\nModel 3 / Model Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\\nModel Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Texas\\nModel Y\\nActive\\n \\nCybertruck\\nActive\\nGigafactory Nevada\\nTesla Semi\\nPilot production\\nVarious\\nNext Generation Platform\\nIn development\\nTBD\\nTesla Roadster\\nIn development\\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and\\nnext generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and\\nefficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our\\nnext generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in\\nproduction volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our\\nplans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability\\nand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’\\nperformance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features\\nand delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\\noperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current\\nchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These\\nmacroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our\\noperating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust\\naccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest\\nfactories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will\\nhelp enable future growth.\\n34\\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our\\ntotal deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the\\ncost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and\\ncharging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer\\nsatisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and\\nagreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer\\ndemands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of\\nour energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our\\nMegafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of\\nspecific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering\\nexperience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we\\nwill have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled\\nelectricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time,\\nand may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping\\nmanufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger\\nnetwork and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending\\non overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital\\nefficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all\\nother continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital\\nmanagement resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash\\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\\nprovide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain\\nand labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as\\nlong as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The\\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions\\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\\nAccordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\\nongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,\\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\\n35\\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\\nreserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of\\nfinancial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have\\nassessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially\\naffected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\\n606”), including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-\\nair software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration\\nfor expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when\\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information\\nthat may be available.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n36\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee\\nstock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock\\noption awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our\\ncommon stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\\nincome taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely\\nthan not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted\\nfor permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in\\nrecent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected\\nfuture results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our\\ncommon stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in\\nbusiness that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of\\nfuture results considering all available information.\\n37\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and\\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes\\npayable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in\\neffect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to\\nour tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\\nexperience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations,\\nsuch differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\\nResults of Operations\\nRevenues\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\\n2022 vs. 2021 Change\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n$\\n%\\n$\\n%\\nAutomotive sales\\n$\\n78,509 \\n$\\n67,210 \\n$\\n44,125 \\n$\\n11,299 \\n17 %\\n$\\n23,085 \\n52 %\\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\n1,790 \\n1,776 \\n1,465 \\n14 \\n1 %\\n311 \\n21 %\\nAutomotive leasing\\n2,120 \\n2,476 \\n1,642 \\n(356)\\n(14)%\\n834 \\n51 %\\nTotal automotive revenues\\n82,419 \\n71,462 \\n47,232 \\n10,957 \\n15 %\\n24,230 \\n51 %\\nServices and other\\n8,319 \\n6,091 \\n3,802 \\n2,228 \\n37 %\\n2,289 \\n60 %\\nTotal automotive & services and other segment\\nrevenue\\n90,738 \\n77,553 \\n51,034 \\n13,185 \\n17 %\\n26,519 \\n52 %\\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue\\n6,035 \\n3,909 \\n2,789 \\n2,126 \\n54 %\\n1,120 \\n40 %\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n96,773 \\n$\\n81,462 \\n$\\n53,823 \\n$\\n15,311 \\n19 %\\n$\\n27,639 \\n51 %\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, Model Y, and\\nCybertruck vehicles, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs\\nand over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory\\ncredits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles\\nare sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or\\nchanges in regulation impacting the credits.\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive\\nleasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the\\ncustomer.\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\\n2023 compared to 2022\\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $11.30 billion, or 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31,\\n2022, primarily due to an increase of 473,382 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries from production ramping of Model Y globally. The increase\\nwas partially offset by a lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year, sales mix, and a negative impact\\nfrom the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.\\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue increased $14 million, or 1%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\n38\\nAutomotive leasing revenue decreased $356 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31,\\n2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year, partially offset by an\\nincrease from our growing direct operating lease portfolio.\\nServices and other revenue increased $2.23 billion, or 37%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31,\\n2022. The increase was primarily due to higher used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume, body shop and part sales revenue, non-warranty\\nmaintenance services revenue, paid Supercharging revenue and insurance services revenue, all of which are primarily attributable to our growing fleet.\\nThe increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of used vehicles.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, financing of solar energy\\ngeneration products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\n2023 compared to 2022\\nEnergy generation and storage revenue increased $2.13 billion, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022.

Cost of automotive sales revenue increased in line with the change in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. The increase\\nwas partially offset by a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily due to sales mix, lower inbound freight, a decrease in\\nmaterial costs and lower manufacturing costs from better fixed cost absorption. Our costs of revenue were also positively impacted by the United States\\ndollar strengthening against our foreign currencies as compared to the prior periods and by the IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current year.\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $241 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022.

The decrease was primarily due to a lower average selling price on our vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in our\\naverage combined cost per unit of our vehicles and IRA manufacturing credits earned as discussed above.\\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.5% to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as\\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense,\\nother overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write\\ndown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess\\nof forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar\\nenergy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems,\\nmaintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n2023 compared to 2022\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.27 billion, or 35%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2022, in line with the increase in Megapack deployments year over year, as discussed above. This increase was partially offset by an\\nimprovement in production ramping that drove down the average cost per MWh of Megapack as well as IRA manufacturing credits earned during the\\ncurrent year.\\n40\\nGross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 7.4% to 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by an improvement in our Megapack gross margin from lower average cost per MWh and a higher\\nproportion of Megapack, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment as compared to the prior year periods.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and\\nverifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state\\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\\nassets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. Approximately $5.93 billion of the total valuation allowance release was related to\\ndeferred tax assets to be realized in the future years and the remainder benefited us during the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to maintain\\na full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to\\nbe realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets generation in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\\nOur (benefit from) provision for income taxes changed by $6.13 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax\\nassets.\\nOur effective tax rate changed from an expense of 8% to a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance regarding our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets.\\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last five fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core\\noperations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our\\nproprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued\\nexpansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation\\ncapabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\\n42\\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our\\ncapital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly\\nthan expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures.\\nFinally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid\\ngrowth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time\\ndetermine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31,\\n2023, as well as in the long-term.\\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such\\nneeds.\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to\\nbe used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and\\nproduction ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts\\nbeyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an\\nagreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through\\nDecember 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was memorialized\\nin an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments\\nand Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.98\\nbillion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, our total minimum lease payments was $5.96 billion, of which\\n$1.31 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note 12,\\nLeases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and\\ninstallations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $16.40 billion and $12.70 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances\\nheld in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $4.43 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.03 billion of unused\\ncommitted credit amounts as of December 31, 2023. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments,\\nto do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.\\n43\\nSummary of Cash Flows\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$\\n13,256 \\n$\\n14,724 \\n$\\n11,497 \\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$\\n(15,584)\\n$\\n(11,973)\\n$\\n(7,868)\\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\\n$\\n2,589 \\n$\\n(3,527)\\n$\\n(5,203)\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as\\nresearch and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and\\nrelated servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage\\nproducts, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials\\nand parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.47 billion to $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 from $14.72 billion\\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses\\nof $2.93 billion, partially offset by favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.46 billion.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $8.90 billion for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly for global factory expansion and machinery and\\nequipment as we expand our product roadmap. We also purchased $6.62 billion and $5.81 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and\\nsales, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, proceeds from sales of digital assets was $936 million in the year\\nended December 31, 2022.\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash from financing activities changed by $6.12 billion to $2.59 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023 from $3.53 billion net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to a\\n$3.93 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $2.01 billion decrease in repayments of debt. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\n44\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating\\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general,\\nwe are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating\\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-\\nmeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and\\ncash and cash equivalents balances).\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and\\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on\\nour net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023 and $473 million at\\nDecember 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\\n45\\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChanges in Accounting Principles\\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2021.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\\nOur audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\\nbasis for our opinions.\\n47\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\\neffect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $5,152\\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for\\nthese products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified.\\nThese estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are\\nthe significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant\\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency\\nand costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the automotive warranty\\nreserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of\\nfuture claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one\\nof the following: (i) testing management’s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an\\nindependent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management’s\\nestimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management’s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant\\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the\\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating\\nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred.\\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims\\nwere appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in\\ndeveloping an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain\\naspects of management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 26,

(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we\\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary\\ncourse of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our\\ndirect vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC\\n810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits\\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not\\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity\\nArrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,\\ndetermining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts\\nand finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\\naccompanying notes.\\n54\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue by source\\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAutomotive sales\\n$\\n78,509 \\n$\\n67,210 \\n$\\n44,125 \\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\n1,790 \\n1,776 \\n1,465 \\nEnergy generation and storage sales\\n5,515 \\n3,376 \\n2,279 \\nServices and other\\n8,319 \\n6,091 \\n3,802 \\nTotal revenues from sales and services\\n94,133 \\n78,453 \\n51,671 \\nAutomotive leasing\\n2,120 \\n2,476 \\n1,642 \\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\\n520 \\n533 \\n510 \\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n96,773 \\n$\\n81,462 \\n$\\n53,823 \\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet\\nconnectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,\\nwhich is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return\\nreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback\\nterms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are\\nprovisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We\\nrecognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\\nRevenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized\\nover time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales\\nrevenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to\\nautomotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to\\nshipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\\nvehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\n55\\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs,\\nwe originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the\\ntransaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the\\nlease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s contract residual value at the end\\nof the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been\\nchanges to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as\\nmarket conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles sold under this program was\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging\\nprograms and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nDeferred revenue— beginning of period\\n$\\n2,913 \\n$\\n2,382 \\nAdditions\\n1,201 \\n1,178 \\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\\n17 \\n(67)\\nRevenue recognized\\n(595)\\n(580)\\nDeferred revenue— end of period\\n$\\n3,536 \\n$\\n2,913 \\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as\\nof the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $469 million for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023. We had recognized revenue of $472 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021, for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred\\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize $926 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be\\nrecognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have\\nrecorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $242 million and $128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts\\nreceivable, net, for the current portion and $1.04 billion and $665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term\\nportion.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and\\nclean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment\\nterms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated\\nwith them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory\\ncredits was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\\nwas immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in\\nrevenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\\n56\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying\\ncustomers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to\\nreturn the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458 million and $407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases\\n(“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to\\nus during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease\\nterm after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be\\nexercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual\\npayments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-\\ntype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest\\nincome based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue\\nand $164 million, $427 million and $234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell\\nused vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle\\ncomponents, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary\\nto the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within\\nCustomer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from\\ncustomers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue\\nexcluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n57\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small\\ncommercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,\\ncustomers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time\\nusing the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy\\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system\\nwill meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the\\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $1.60 billion and $863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the\\ndeferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $571 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nrespectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance\\nobligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to\\ninvoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to\\nperformance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.43\\nbillion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $1.05 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nwe have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $31 million and $24 million, respectively, is recorded within\\nAccounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $578 million and $387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-\\nterm portion.\\n58\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease\\nrevenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the\\nlease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is\\nrecorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these\\nagreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity\\ndelivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized,\\nwhich is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $181 million and $191 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives\\nreceived from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.\\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales\\ncommissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\\nCost of Revenues\\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling\\nand machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD Capability ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and\\ninfrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes\\nadjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to\\nprovide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing\\ncredits earned.\\nAutomotive Leasing\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases\\nand warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\\nServices and Other\\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty\\nafter-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for\\nretail merchandise.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, overhead costs, freight, warranty expense, and\\namortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value\\nof our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\\nAdditionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and\\nPPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs\\nassociated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n59\\nResearch and Development Costs\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under\\nwhich deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities\\nusing enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when\\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is\\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\\ndeferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual\\nearnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary\\ndifferences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.\\nOur valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\\nUnder GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such\\namounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nComprehensive Income\\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign\\ncurrency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee\\nservices received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is\\nestimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the\\nrisk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of\\nRSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during\\nwhich an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options\\nand RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\n60\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\\narrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined\\nthat the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a\\nbalance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling\\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV\\nmethod, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the\\namounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets\\nof the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\\ndistributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling\\ninterest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after\\ntaking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least\\nequal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the\\nconsolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there\\nhave been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due\\nto changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been reached.\\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common\\nstockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-\\naverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or\\nthe if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders\\nwhen their effect is dilutive.\\nFurthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11,\\nDebt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The\\nstrike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the\\nweighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and\\ndiluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n14,997 \\n$\\n12,556 \\n$\\n5,519 \\nLess: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest\\n(2)\\n(27)\\n(5)\\nNet income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock\\n14,999 \\n12,583 \\n5,524 \\nLess: Dilutive convertible debt\\n— \\n(1)\\n(9)\\nNet income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock\\n$\\n14,999 \\n$\\n12,584 \\n$\\n5,533 \\n61\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common\\nstock attributable to common stockholders (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock,\\nbasic\\n3,174\\n3,130\\n2,959\\nAdd:\\nStock-based awards\\n298\\n310\\n292\\nConvertible senior notes\\n2\\n3\\n29\\nWarrants\\n11\\n32\\n106\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock,\\ndiluted\\n3,485\\n3,475\\n3,386\\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common\\nstock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nStock-based awards\\n12\\n4\\n1\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the\\nfair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the\\nacquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and\\nnoncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the\\ntotal purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of\\nthe identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling\\ninterests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash\\nequivalents are primarily comprised of U.S. government securities, money market funds and commercial paper.\\nRestricted Cash\\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain\\npayments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value\\nguarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\\n62\\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n16,398 \\n$\\n16,253 \\n$\\n17,576 \\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets\\n543 \\n294 \\n345 \\nRestricted cash included in other non-current assets\\n248 \\n377 \\n223 \\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows\\n$\\n17,189 \\n$\\n16,924 \\n$\\n18,144 \\nInvestments\\nInvestments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, including U.S. government securities, corporate debt securities,\\ncommercial paper, time deposits, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value,\\nwith unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale\\nmarketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest\\nincome in our consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-\\nsale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the\\ndecline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our\\ninvestments approximates its fair value.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing\\nproducts to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and\\ngovernment rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be\\nuncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for\\ncertain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to\\napproximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of\\nregulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected\\ndepending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our\\naccounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $207 million and $753 million, respectively, of long-term\\ngovernment rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nFinancing Receivables\\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of\\nallowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels\\nconsidered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level\\nof credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.\\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score)\\nand other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant\\ncredit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\\n63\\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing\\nreceivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an immaterial balance being past due. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of\\nDecember 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022.\\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the\\npurchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for\\nexpected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current\\nportion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total outstanding balance of MyPower\\ncustomer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $266 million and $280 million, respectively, of which $5 million and $7 million\\nwere due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for expected credit\\nlosses was $36 million and $37 million, respectively.\\nConcentration of Risk\\nCredit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash,\\naccounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions\\nor invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no entity represented\\n10% or more of our total receivables balance.\\nSupply Risk\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our\\nproducts in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these\\nsuppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\nOperating Lease Vehicles\\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the\\ncontractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.36 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively.\\nOperating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.38 billion and $1.04 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n64\\nDigital Assets, Net\\nWe currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. We\\nhave ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at\\ncost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.\\nWe determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), based\\non quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each\\nquarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more\\nlikely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of\\ndigital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair\\nvalue determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their\\ncarrying values and the prices determined.\\nImpairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment\\nis identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets\\nheld within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying\\nvalue of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nSolar energy systems in service\\n30 to 35 years\\nInitial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs\\nLease term (up to 25 years)\\nSolar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and\\nplaced in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy\\nsystems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement\\nacquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\\ngenerally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture\\n3 to 15 years\\nTooling\\n4 to 7 years\\nBuilding and building improvements\\n15 to 30 years\\nComputer equipment and software\\n3 to 10 years\\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the\\nconsolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures\\nare expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated\\nratably over the identified useful life.\\n65\\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in\\nprogress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events\\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by\\ncomparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying\\namount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we have recognized no material impairments\\nof our long-lived assets.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years.\\nGoodwill\\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be\\nimpaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we did not\\nrecognize any impairment of goodwill.\\nCapitalization of Software Costs\\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and\\nequipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\\nincurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.\\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the\\nestablishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become\\nsignificant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur\\nthat could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we have recognized no impairments of\\ncapitalized software costs.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary\\ncurrency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by\\nthe different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional\\nexchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other\\nthan the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $122 million,\\nloss of $89 million and gain of $97 million, respectively.\\n66\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty\\nactivity consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\\n$\\n3,505 \\n$\\n2,101 \\n$\\n1,468 \\nWarranty costs incurred\\n(1,225)\\n(803)\\n(525)\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign\\nexchange impact\\n539 \\n522 \\n102 \\nProvision for warranty\\n2,333 \\n1,685 \\n1,056 \\nAccrued warranty—end of period\\n$\\n5,152 \\n$\\n3,505 \\n$\\n2,101 \\nCustomer Deposits\\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an\\nenergy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on\\ncontracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and\\nother on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.\\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives\\nare recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset.\\nThe benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable\\nassurance of their receipt.\\nThe IRA Incentives\\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple\\nincentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative\\nminimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to\\nmaterially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a\\nreduction of our material costs in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IRA as more guidance is issued\\nand the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements.\\n67\\nGigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease\\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related\\nresearch and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants,\\nincluding hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction\\ncosts related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any\\nconstruction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease\\ncosts of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nGigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we\\nare required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai\\ngovernment has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at\\nGigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received grant funding of $76\\nmillion. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property,\\nplant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of\\nthe related equipment.\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that\\nprovide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of\\ncapital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we\\nwould receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle\\nIndependent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case\\nsubject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is\\nrecorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements\\nof operations. As of December 31, 2023, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial.\\nDefined Contribution Plan\\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue\\nCode and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their\\neligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a\\nmaximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31,\\n2023 and 2022, we recognized $99 million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\\n68\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\n(Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are\\nregularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also\\nrequires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a\\nsegment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to\\nall prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required\\ndisclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain\\ncrypto assets to be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other\\nintangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto holding. The ASU is\\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a\\ncumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the\\namendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity\\nmust adopt the ASU as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU will result in gains and losses recorded in the\\nconsolidated financial statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it will\\naffect the carrying value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, once adopted.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated\\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not\\nyet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial\\nstatements, once adopted.\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic\\n805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from\\nacquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had\\noriginated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal\\nyears. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance\\nfor troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted\\non January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is\\nexperiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-\\noffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods\\nbeginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU\\nhas not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n69\\nASU 2020-06\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies\\nthe accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for\\nconvertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives\\nunder Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no\\nlonger required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized\\ncost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when\\napplying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the\\nmost significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share\\nsettlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies\\nfor a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or\\nliabilities.\\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $211 million cumulative effect of\\ninitially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity\\nconversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $474 million and convertible senior notes\\n(mezzanine equity) was reduced by $51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of\\nincreasing our net debt balance by $269 million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45 million related to previously capitalized interest.\\nThe prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in\\neffect for those periods.\\nNote 3 – Digital Assets, Net\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets. During the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment losses on digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded\\n$204 million of impairment losses on digital assets and realized gains of $64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat\\ncurrency. The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31,\\n2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our digital assets held reflects cumulative impairment of $204 million.\\nNote 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill increased $59 million within the automotive segment from $194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $253 million as of December 31, 2023\\nprimarily from a business combination, net of the impact of a divestiture. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2023 and\\n2022.\\nThe net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $215 million as of December 31, 2022 to $178 million as of December 31, 2023\\nmainly from amortization.\\nNote 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an\\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should\\nbe determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\\nII) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is\\nlittle or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and\\nliabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\\n70\\n \\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n \\nFair Value\\nLevel I\\nLevel II\\nLevel III\\nFair Value\\nLevel I\\nLevel II\\nLevel III\\nMoney market funds\\n$\\n109 \\n$\\n109 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n2,188 \\n$\\n2,188 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n— \\nU.S. government securities\\n5,136 \\n— \\n5,136 \\n— \\n894 \\n— \\n894 \\n— \\nCorporate debt securities\\n480 \\n— \\n480 \\n— \\n885 \\n— \\n885 \\n— \\nCertificates of deposit and time\\ndeposits\\n6,996 \\n— \\n6,996 \\n— \\n4,253 \\n— \\n4,253 \\n— \\nCommercial paper\\n470 \\n— \\n470 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nTotal\\n$\\n13,191 \\n$\\n109 \\n$\\n13,082 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n8,220 \\n$\\n2,188 \\n$\\n6,032 \\n$\\n— \\nAll of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active\\nmarkets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level\\nII of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments.\\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):\\n \\nDecember 31, 2023\\n \\nAdjusted Cost\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nGains\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and Cash\\nEquivalents\\nShort-Term\\nInvestments\\nCash\\n$\\n15,903 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n15,903 \\n$\\n15,903 \\n$\\n— \\nMoney market funds\\n109 \\n— \\n— \\n109 \\n109 \\n— \\nU.S. government securities\\n5,136 \\n1 \\n(1)\\n5,136 \\n277 \\n4,859 \\nCorporate debt securities\\n485 \\n1 \\n(6)\\n480 \\n— \\n480 \\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\\n6,995 \\n1 \\n— \\n6,996 \\n— \\n6,996 \\nCommercial paper\\n470 \\n— \\n— \\n470 \\n109 \\n361 \\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term\\ninvestments\\n$\\n29,098 \\n$\\n3 \\n$\\n(7)\\n$\\n29,094 \\n$\\n16,398 \\n$\\n12,696 \\n \\nDecember 31, 2022\\n \\nAdjusted Cost\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nGains\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and Cash\\nEquivalents\\nShort-Term\\nInvestments\\nCash\\n$\\n13,965 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n13,965 \\n$\\n13,965 \\n$\\n— \\nMoney market funds\\n2,188 \\n— \\n— \\n2,188 \\n2,188 \\n— \\nU.S. government securities\\n897 \\n— \\n(3)\\n894 \\n— \\n894 \\nCorporate debt securities\\n907 \\n— \\n(22)\\n885 \\n— \\n885 \\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\\n4,252 \\n1 \\n— \\n4,253 \\n100 \\n4,153 \\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term\\ninvestments\\n$\\n22,209 \\n$\\n1 \\n$\\n(25)\\n$\\n22,185 \\n$\\n16,253 \\n$\\n5,932 \\nWe record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\\noperations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending\\nallowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our\\ninvestments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were temporary in nature.\\n71\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\\nDue in 1 year or less\\n$\\n12,374 \\nDue in 1 year through 5 years\\n297 \\nDue in 5 years through 10 years\\n25 \\nTotal\\n$\\n12,696 \\nDisclosure of Fair Values\\nOur financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, other receivables, digital assets,\\naccounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments materially approximate their fair\\nvalues, other than our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”) and digital assets.\\nWe estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are\\nindirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II).

Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As\\nthe terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production\\ncommences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes,\\nexcept production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property,\\nplant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on\\nPanasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated\\nproductive life of the respective assets.

Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our\\nsubsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As\\nof December 31, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.\\n2024 Notes\\nThe closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30\\nconsecutive trading days of each quarter in 2023, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. As of December\\n31, 2023, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $406 million. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled\\nin cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.\\nCredit Agreement\\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a\\nsyndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus\\n0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain\\nof our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain\\nreserves.\\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to\\nreplace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total\\ncommitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for\\ngeneral corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR\\n(the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the\\nsterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case,\\nplus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit\\nRating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\\n75\\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose\\nentities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial\\nstatements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-\\nbacked Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the\\nassociated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to\\nour other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\\nIn 2023, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and financing receivables into SPEs and issued $3.93 billion in\\naggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The\\nproceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $3.92 billion.\\nCash Equity Debt\\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that\\nbears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.\\nAutomotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities\\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we terminated our Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities and the previously committed funds are no longer\\navailable for future borrowings.\\nPledged Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had pledged or restricted $4.64 billion and $2.02 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating\\nlease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.\\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nRecourse debt\\nNon-recourse debt\\nTotal\\n2024\\n$\\n37 \\n$\\n1,941 \\n$\\n1,978 \\n2025\\n4 \\n1,663 \\n1,667 \\n2026\\n— \\n494 \\n494 \\n2027\\n— \\n276 \\n276 \\n2028\\n— \\n44 \\n44 \\nThereafter\\n3 \\n221 \\n224 \\nTotal\\n$\\n44 \\n$\\n4,639 \\n$\\n4,683 \\nNote 12 – Leases\\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and\\nservice locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a\\nlease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made\\navailable for use by the lessor.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-\\nlease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type\\nleases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for\\nthe non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating\\nlease.\\n76\\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease\\ninception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are\\nrecognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an\\nimplicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the\\npresent value of lease payments.\\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to\\nterminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or\\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending\\non the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the\\npresent value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated\\nlease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues\\nor operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within\\nInterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance\\nsheets:\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nOperating leases:\\n \\n \\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n4,180 \\n$\\n2,563 \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other\\n$\\n672 \\n$\\n485 \\nOther long-term liabilities\\n3,671 \\n2,164 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n4,343 \\n$\\n2,649 \\n \\nFinance leases:\\n \\n \\nSolar energy systems, net\\n$\\n23 \\n$\\n25 \\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\\n601 \\n1,094 \\nTotal finance lease assets\\n$\\n624 \\n$\\n1,119 \\n \\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance leases\\n$\\n398 \\n$\\n486 \\nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion\\n175 \\n568 \\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n573 \\n$\\n1,054 \\n77\\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nOperating lease expense:\\n \\n \\n \\nOperating lease expense (1)\\n$\\n1,153 \\n$\\n798 \\n$\\n627 \\n \\nFinance lease expense:\\nAmortization of leased assets\\n$\\n506 \\n$\\n493 \\n$\\n415 \\nInterest on lease liabilities\\n45 \\n72 \\n89 \\nTotal finance lease expense\\n$\\n551 \\n$\\n565 \\n$\\n504 \\n \\nTotal lease expense\\n$\\n1,704 \\n$\\n1,363 \\n$\\n1,131 \\n(1)\\nIncludes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial.\\nOther information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\\nOperating leases\\n7.4 years\\n6.4 years\\nFinance leases\\n2.3 years\\n3.1 years\\n \\nWeighted-average discount rate:\\nOperating leases\\n5.6 %\\n5.3 %\\nFinance leases\\n5.5 %\\n5.7 %\\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases\\n$\\n1,084 \\n$\\n754 \\n$\\n616 \\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments)\\n$\\n47 \\n$\\n75 \\n$\\n89 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n10 \\n$\\n58 \\n$\\n486 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n2,170 \\n$\\n1,059 \\n$\\n818 \\n78\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions):\\n \\nOperating\\nLeases\\nFinance\\nLeases\\n2024\\n$\\n892 \\n$\\n418 \\n2025\\n831 \\n81 \\n2026\\n706 \\n57 \\n2027\\n603 \\n38 \\n2028\\n508 \\n2 \\nThereafter\\n1,820 \\n4 \\nTotal minimum lease payments\\n5,360 \\n600 \\nLess: Interest\\n1,017 \\n27 \\nPresent value of lease obligations\\n4,343 \\n573 \\nLess: Current portion\\n672 \\n398 \\nLong-term portion of lease obligations\\n$\\n3,671 \\n$\\n175 \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have excluded from the table above additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent\\npayments of $1.53 billion.

These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25\\nyears.\\nUnder a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in\\nsome cases, subsequent periodic payments. As of December 31, 2023, the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors, for\\neach of the next five years and thereafter, were as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\n$\\n18 \\n2025\\n27 \\n2026\\n28 \\n2027\\n29 \\n2028\\n29 \\nThereafter\\n337 \\nTotal\\n$\\n468 \\nNote 13 – Equity Incentive Plans\\nIn June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock,\\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the\\n2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees.\\nNonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and\\nour stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or\\nconsulting relationship ends.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, 131.1 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.\\n80\\nThe following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\\nStock Options\\nRSUs\\nNumber of\\nOptions\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nExercise\\nPrice\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nRemaining\\nContractual\\nLife (years)\\nAggregate\\nIntrinsic\\nValue\\n(in billions)\\nNumber\\nof RSUs\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant\\nDate Fair\\nValue\\nBeginning of period\\n343,564\\n$\\n30.65 \\n21,333\\n$\\n162.32 \\nGranted\\n9,521\\n$\\n226.50 \\n11,743\\n$\\n228.33 \\nExercised or released\\n(7,626)\\n$\\n43.07 \\n(11,085)\\n$\\n116.47 \\nCancelled\\n(1,438)\\n$\\n194.23 \\n(2,903)\\n$\\n192.22 \\nEnd of period\\n344,021\\n$\\n35.11 \\n4.31\\n$\\n73.57 \\n19,088\\n$\\n225.01 \\nVested and expected to vest, December 31, 2023\\n340,884\\n$\\n33.38 \\n4.27\\n$\\n73.45 \\n18,446\\n$\\n225.76 \\nExercisable and vested, December 31, 2023\\n329,124\\n$\\n27.07 \\n4.11\\n$\\n72.90 \\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $228.33, $239.85 and\\n$261.33, respectively. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2.50 billion, $4.32\\nbillion and $5.70 billion, respectively.\\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.33 billion, $1.90 billion and\\n$26.88 billion, respectively.

The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering\\nperiod. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, under the ESPP we issued 2.1 million, 1.4 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 97.8 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\\nFair Value Assumptions\\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each\\nstock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing\\nmodel. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nRisk-free interest rate\\n3.90 %\\n3.11 %\\n0.66 %\\nExpected term (in years)\\n4.5\\n4.1\\n4.3\\nExpected volatility\\n63 %\\n63 %\\n59 %\\nDividend yield\\n0.0 %\\n0.0 %\\n0.0 %\\nGrant date fair value per share\\n$\\n121.62 \\n$\\n114.51 \\n$\\n128.02 \\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of\\nour common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each\\ngrant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average\\nof the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\\n81\\n2018 CEO Performance Award\\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 304.0 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020\\nStock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 vesting\\ntranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions,\\nassuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each\\nof the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization\\nmilestone for such tranche, which began at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six\\ncalendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), had been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following\\neight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA had been achieved for\\nthe four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms\\n10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA was defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for\\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of\\n$23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years\\npost-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2023 is provided below.\\nTotal Annualized Revenue\\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\\nMilestone\\n(in billions)\\nAchievement Status\\nMilestone\\n(in billions)\\nAchievement Status\\n$\\n20.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n1.5 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n35.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n3.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n55.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n4.5 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n75.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n6.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n100.0 \\n-\\n$\\n8.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n125.0 \\n-\\n$\\n10.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n150.0 \\n-\\n$\\n12.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n175.0 \\n-\\n$\\n14.0 \\nAchieved\\nStock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represented a non-cash expense and was recorded as a Selling, general, and\\nadministrative operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we\\nhad recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponded to the\\nnumber of operational milestones that had been achieved or had been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the\\nfollowing principles.\\nOn the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the\\nfuture time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone\\nachievement time.” Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter, we determined whether it was\\nprobable that we would achieve each operational milestone that had not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the\\nfuture time when we expected to achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.”\\nAs of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award had been\\nrecognized. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $66 million and $910 million,\\nrespectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\n82\\nOther Performance-Based Grants\\nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $655 million under these grants to purchase or receive an\\naggregate 5.3 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation\\nexpense of $110 million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $57 million and $159 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense\\nrelated to these grants, net of forfeitures.\\nSummary Stock-Based Compensation Information\\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCost of revenues\\n$\\n741 \\n$\\n594 \\n$\\n421 \\nResearch and development\\n689 \\n536 \\n448 \\nSelling, general and administrative\\n382 \\n430 \\n1,252 \\nTotal\\n$\\n1,812 \\n$\\n1,560 \\n$\\n2,121 \\nOur income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements were immaterial while we were under full valuation allowances\\non our U.S. deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the release of the valuation allowance associated with our\\nfederal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023, income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense were $326 million during\\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our\\nconsolidated balance sheets was $199 million, $245 million and $182 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had $4.82 billion of total\\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8\\nyears.\\nNote 14 – Income Taxes\\nOur income before (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nDomestic\\n$\\n3,196 \\n$\\n5,524 \\n$\\n(130)\\nNoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest\\n(23)\\n31 \\n125 \\nForeign\\n6,800 \\n8,164 \\n6,348 \\nIncome before income taxes\\n$\\n9,973 \\n$\\n13,719 \\n$\\n6,343 \\n83\\nA (benefit from) provision for income taxes of $(5.00) billion, $1.13 billion and $699 million has been recognized for the years ended December 31,\\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and\\nverifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state\\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\\nassets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax\\nassets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to be realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets\\ngeneration in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\\n84\\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDeferred tax assets:\\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\\n$\\n2,826 \\n$\\n4,486 \\nResearch and development credits\\n1,358 \\n1,184 \\nOther tax credits and attributes\\n827 \\n217 \\nDeferred revenue\\n1,035 \\n751 \\nInventory and warranty reserves\\n1,258 \\n819 \\nStock-based compensation\\n230 \\n185 \\nOperating lease right-of-use liabilities\\n930 \\n554 \\nCapitalized research and development costs\\n1,344 \\n693 \\nDeferred GILTI tax assets\\n760 \\n466 \\nAccruals and others\\n206 \\n178 \\nTotal deferred tax assets\\n10,774 \\n9,533 \\nValuation allowance\\n(892)\\n(7,349)\\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\\n9,882 \\n2,184 \\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n(2,122)\\n(1,178)\\nInvestment in certain financing funds\\n(133)\\n(238)\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n(859)\\n(506)\\nOther\\n(116)\\n(15)\\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\\n(3,230)\\n(1,937)\\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowance\\n$\\n6,652 \\n$\\n247 \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained valuation allowances of $892 million for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be\\nrealized, which primarily included deferred tax assets in the state of California and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net\\ndeferred tax assets decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by\\n$6.14 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due\\nto the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The changes in valuation allowances\\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respective year.\\nAmong our deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses that are not more likely\\nthan not to be realized. The remainder of our foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings\\nin these jurisdictions.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.31 billion of federal and $10.36 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future\\ntaxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2024 for federal and state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial\\nrestrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the\\nInternal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-\\nforwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.10 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of\\n$605 million, and state research and development tax credits of $923 million. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of\\nCalifornia. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2036. However, California research and development\\ntax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\\n85\\nThe local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25%\\nstatutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15% for 2019 through\\n2023. Starting in 2024, Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to 25% statutory corporate income tax rate in China.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs.\\nWe have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest,\\nno deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability\\nassociated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $245 million.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2020\\n$\\n380 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n117 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n(90)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n124 \\nDecember 31, 2021\\n531 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n136 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n(12)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n222 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\n(7)\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n870 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n59 \\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\\n(6)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n255 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\n(4)\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n$\\n1,174 \\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we have accrued $47 million and $31 million,\\nrespectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $901 million, if recognized, would affect our\\neffective tax rate.\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue\\nService (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for\\nfederal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax\\npurposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\\nNote 15 – Commitments and Contingencies\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under\\nthe lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\\n86\\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in\\nthe State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other\\ncosts in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each\\nanniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million\\n“program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to\\na material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses,\\ncosts of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that\\nwe had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2023, we have met and\\nexpect to meet the requirements under this arrangement based on our current and anticipated level of operations. However, if our expectations as to the\\ncosts and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial\\npayments to the SUNY Foundation.\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have\\nbeen constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the\\nend of 2023, which has been achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31,\\n2023, we have met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and\\nthe members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their\\nfiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing\\nand argument are now complete.\\nLitigation Related to Directors’ Compensation\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against\\ncertain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and\\n2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and\\nother relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any\\nwrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of\\nthe agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the\\nsettlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement. The settlement is not expected\\nto have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection\\nwith Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint\\nin the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The\\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated\\nto certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a\\njury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new\\ntrial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On July 14, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.\\n87\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of\\nTesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions\\nconnected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five\\nof those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated\\npurported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then\\nconstituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported\\nstockholder class action.\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that\\nboard members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among\\nother things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\\nparties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 5, 2024.\\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a\\nstock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the\\nstrike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a\\nviolation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges\\nthat it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the\\nstrike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points\\nthat JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have\\nknown would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially\\nreasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that\\nmotion is currently pending before the Court.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a\\nformer contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. A retrial was\\nheld starting on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $3,175,000. As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from\\nan initial $136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On November 2,\\n2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on November 16, 2023, Tesla filed a notice of cross appeal.\\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint\\nagainst Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among\\nothers. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD,\\nalleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was\\nsubject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the\\nCRD’s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On December 18, 2023,\\nTesla filed a motion to stay the case. Separately, on December 26, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to dismiss the case.\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on\\nbehalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and\\nviolation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs\\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases\\nand on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on\\nSeptember 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an\\namended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\\n88\\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other\\nconsumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on\\nSeptember 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later\\nconsolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and\\nother relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class\\naction complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same\\ndefendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to\\namend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a\\npreliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD\\nCapability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the\\naccuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a\\npreliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On\\nOctober 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. On\\nOctober 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego\\nCounty case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California.\\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk\\nand certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about\\nthe Company’s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock\\nbetween February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as\\ndefendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several\\nsimilar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates\\nfederal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid\\nTesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated\\namended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17,\\n2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12,\\n2023, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs have also appealed the court’s arbitration order. Trial is currently set for July 7, 2025.\\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably\\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway\\nTraffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Justice\\n(“DOJ”), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology\\n(e.g., vehicle functionality, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla’s business, its personnel,\\nand related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge\\nno government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any\\nongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our\\nbusiness, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\n89\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during\\nthe second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business\\nand personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and\\nwe are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court\\nfor the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits,\\nthat each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in\\nthese or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations,\\nprospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nLetters of Credit\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $525 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\\nNote 16 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In\\nparticular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into\\nrelated agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits\\ncriterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect\\nthe operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these\\nVIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the\\nagreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of\\nthese VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash\\ndistributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss\\nand tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or\\nthe formula specified in the agreements.\\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as\\noperations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the\\nfund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the\\nfunds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\\n90\\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the\\nconsolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAssets\\n \\n \\nCurrent assets\\n \\n \\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n66 \\n$\\n68 \\nAccounts receivable, net\\n13 \\n22 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n361 \\n274 \\nTotal current assets\\n440 \\n364 \\nSolar energy systems, net\\n3,278 \\n4,060 \\nOther non-current assets\\n369 \\n404 \\nTotal assets\\n$\\n4,087 \\n$\\n4,828 \\nLiabilities\\n \\n \\nCurrent liabilities\\n \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other\\n$\\n67 \\n$\\n69 \\nDeferred revenue\\n6 \\n10 \\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\\n1,564 \\n1,013 \\nTotal current liabilities\\n1,637 \\n1,092 \\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\\n99 \\n149 \\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion\\n2,041 \\n971 \\nOther long-term liabilities\\n— \\n3 \\nTotal liabilities\\n$\\n3,777 \\n$\\n2,215 \\nNote 17 – Related Party Transactions\\nIn relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate\\namount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for\\nadditional taxes owed, if any.\\nTesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and X Corp., in accordance with\\nour Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n91\\nNote 18 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas\\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the\\ndesign, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive\\nsegment is also comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts,\\npaid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and\\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures\\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are\\nrequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial\\nreporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\\naccounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and\\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\\nof unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted\\nan evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report which is included herein.\\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which has\\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n93\\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”)\\nbelieves that it is appropriate for the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) to be applied to the certain\\nexecutive officers of the Company and adopts this Policy to be effective as of the Effective Date.\\n1. Definitions\\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\\na) “Company Group” means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\\nb) “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person who served as an\\nExecutive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation and that was\\nReceived (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer.\\nc) “Effective Date” means November 15, 2023.\\nd) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation Received by a person during\\nthe fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was\\nattained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been Received by such\\nperson had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any\\ntaxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return,\\nwhere the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly\\nfrom the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation\\nthat constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\\nRestatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted,\\nvested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such\\ndocumentation to Nasdaq.\\ne) “Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\\nf)\\n“Executive Officer” means each “executive officer” of the Company (as defined in Rule 10D-1(d) under the\\nExchange Act), which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers\\npursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Both current and former Executive Officers\\nare subject to the Policy in accordance with its terms.\\n1\\ng) “Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or\\nin part from such measures and may consist of GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under\\nRegulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act), (ii) stock price or (iii)\\ntotal shareholder return. Financial Reporting Measures may or may not be filed with the SEC and may be\\npresented outside the Company’s financial statements, such as in Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Conditions and Result of Operations or in the performance graph required under Item 201(e) of\\nRegulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\\nh) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in\\npart upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\\ni)\\n“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months\\nthat is within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the\\nCompany’s fiscal year) immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee\\nof the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not\\nrequired, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a\\nRestatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on if or\\nwhen the Restatement is actually filed.\\nj)\\n“Nasdaq” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.\\nk) “Received”: Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which\\nthe Financial Reporting Measure specified in or otherwise relating to the Incentive-Based Compensation award is\\nattained, even if the grant, certification of achievement, vesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation\\noccurs after the end of that period.\\nl)\\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement required due to the material noncompliance by the Company\\nwith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including (i) to correct an error in previously\\nissued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to\\nas a “Big R” restatement) or (ii) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is not material\\nto the previously issued financial statements but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were\\ncorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a “little r”\\nrestatement). Changes to the Company’s financial statements that do not represent error corrections under the\\nthen-current relevant accounting standards will not constitute Restatements.\\n2\\nm) “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nn) “Subsidiary” means any domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint\\nventure, trust or unincorporated organization “affiliated” with the Company, that is, directly or indirectly, through\\none or more intermediaries, “controlling”, “controlled by” or “under common control with”, the Company.\\n“Control” for this purpose means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of\\nthe management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, contract or\\notherwise.\\n2. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\\nIn the event of a Restatement, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received during the Lookback Period that (a) is\\nthen-outstanding but has not yet been paid shall be automatically and immediately forfeited or (b) has been paid to any\\nperson shall be subject to reasonably prompt repayment to the Company Group in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy.\\nThe Committee must pursue (and shall not have the discretion to waive) the forfeiture and/or repayment of such\\nErroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy, except as provided below. Recovery of any\\nErroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on fraud or misconduct by any person in connection\\nwith the Restatement.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or, if the Committee is not a committee of the Board responsible for the\\nCompany’s executive compensation decisions and composed entirely of independent directors, a majority of the\\nindependent directors serving on the Board) may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and/or recovery of Erroneously\\nAwarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture and/or recovery would be\\nimpracticable due to any of the following circumstances: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example,\\nreasonable legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered\\n(following reasonable attempts by the Company Group to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\ndocumentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to the Nasdaq) or (ii) recovery would likely\\ncause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Company\\nGroup, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C.\\n401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\\n3. Means of Repayment\\nIn the event that the Committee determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\nCommittee shall provide written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the\\nCompany Group for such person, and the person shall satisfy such repayment in a manner and on such terms as required\\nby the Committee, and the Company Group shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any amount owed to\\nthe person by the Company Group, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Company Group to the person, or\\nto take any and all necessary actions to reasonably promptly recoup the repayment amount from the person, in each case,\\nto the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, including without limitation, Section 409A of the U.S.\\n3\\nInternal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance thereunder. If the Committee does not specify a repayment\\ntiming in the written notice described above, the applicable person shall be required to repay the Erroneously Awarded\\nCompensation to the Company Group by wire, cash or cashier’s check no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such\\nnotice.\\n4. No Indemnification\\nNo person shall be indemnified, insured or reimbursed by the Company Group in respect of any loss of compensation by\\nsuch person in accordance with this Policy, nor shall any person receive any advancement of expenses for disputes related\\nto any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, and no person shall be paid or reimbursed by\\nthe Company Group for any premiums paid by such person for any third-party insurance policy covering potential recovery\\nobligations under this Policy.\\n5. Miscellaneous\\nThis Policy generally will be administered and interpreted by the Committee, provided that the Board may, from time to\\ntime, exercise discretion to administer and interpret this Policy, in which case, all references herein to “Committee” shall be\\ndeemed to refer to the Board. Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and\\nbinding on all interested parties. Any discretionary determinations of the Committee under this Policy, if any, need not be\\nuniform with respect to all persons, and may be made selectively amongst persons, whether or not such persons are\\nsimilarly situated.\\nThis Policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\\nProtection Act, as it may be amended from time to time, Rule 10D- 1 under the Exchange Act, and any related rules or\\nregulations promulgated by the SEC or the Nasdaq, including any additional or new requirements that become effective\\nafter the Effective Date which upon effectiveness shall be deemed to automatically amend this Policy to the extent\\nnecessary to comply with such additional or new requirements.\\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision\\nof this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the\\nmaximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the\\nextent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not\\naffect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\\nunder this Policy is not dependent upon the Company Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any\\nrequirements to provide applicable documentation to the Nasdaq.\\nThe rights of the Company Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in\\nlieu of, any rights of recoupment, or remedies or rights other than recoupment, that may be available to the Company\\nGroup pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement or any other policy,\\ncode of\\n4\\nconduct, employee handbook, employment agreement, equity award agreement, or other plan or agreement of the\\nCompany Group.\\n6. Amendment and Termination\\nTo the extent permitted by, and in a manner consistent with applicable law, including SEC and Nasdaq rules, the\\nCommittee may terminate, suspend or amend this Policy at any time in its discretion.\\n7. Successors\\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all persons and their respective beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\\nadministrators or other legal representatives with respect to any Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to or\\nadministered by such persons or entities.\\n8. Agreement to Arbitrate; Governing Law; Venue\\nThis Policy and all rights and obligations hereunder will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Texas law. \\nAny dispute arising from or relating to this Policy shall be subject to binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current\\nStreamlined Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”).  The existence, content and result\\nof the arbitration shall be held in confidence by the parties, their representatives, any other participants and the arbitrator. \\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement,\\nappointed in accordance with the JAMS rules.  The arbitration shall be conducted in English and in Austin, Texas.  Each\\nparty will bear its own expenses in the arbitration and will share equally the costs of the arbitration; provided, however,\\nthat the arbitrator may, in its discretion, award reasonable costs and fees to the prevailing party.  Judgment upon the\\naward rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If any dispute in arbitration under\\nthis Policy is substantially the same or involves common issues of law or fact, either party shall be entitled to require that\\nany such dispute be consolidated with the relevant arbitration pursuant hereto, and the other party shall permit, and co-\\noperate in, such consolidation.  \\n5\\nTesla, Inc.\\nCLAWBACK POLICY\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT, CONSENT AND AGREEMENT\\nI acknowledge that I have received and reviewed a copy of the Tesla, Inc. Clawback Policy (as may be amended from\\ntime to time, the “Policy”) and I have been given an opportunity to ask questions about the Policy and review it with my\\ncounsel.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer\\nservices related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a\\nglobal network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the\\nwidespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and\\nmanufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership\\nfor our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise,\\nvertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as\\nsales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-\\nwarranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation\\nand storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related\\nservices and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we\\ndesigned for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform\\nwith seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and\\nModel X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we\\nentered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to\\naddress additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) Capability features, battery cell\\nand other technologies.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through\\nchannel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial,\\nutility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater\\ncapacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of\\nmarkets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy Offerings\\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (“PPA”)\\narrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and\\nadequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel\\ncustomers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on\\nnew homes.\\nTechnology\\nAutomotive\\nBattery and Powertrain\\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the\\nunique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective\\nwhile withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction\\nand performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased\\nperformance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-\\nion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower\\ncosts, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles\\noptimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software,\\nincluding most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the\\ndriver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most\\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle\\nsystems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the\\ndesign of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics\\nenables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also\\ndeveloped software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our\\nsolar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate\\nwith Powerwall.\\nDesign and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our\\nteam has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product\\ndevelopment time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method\\nto integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost\\ncharacteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular\\nmarkets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the\\nareas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and\\nstorage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery\\nline is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products,\\nsolar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our\\npublic narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as\\nnecessary.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect Sales\\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have\\ngalleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure\\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more\\naffordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales\\nof vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nUsed Vehicle Sales\\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of\\na new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third\\nparties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-\\nlocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically\\nplaced along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In\\nNovember 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s\\ntransition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging\\nStandard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone\\nand advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced\\ntheir adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no\\nlater than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our\\nnetwork of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\\ncharging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\\nIn-App Upgrades\\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the\\nTesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a\\nsubscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\\nchannels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial\\ncustomers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt\\nclean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nService\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work\\nremotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and\\nimprovements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and\\nremedy many problems remotely and proactively.\\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may include limited\\nwarranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer optional extended service plans that\\nprovide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally provide manufacturer’s\\nlimited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the\\nsystem. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship.\\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we also\\nprovide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable\\nmanufacturers’ warranties.\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that commit that the\\nunderlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in the contract.\\nFinancial Services\\nAutomotive\\nPurchase Financing and Leases\\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia ourselves and\\nthrough various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may\\nobligate us to cover a resale loss up to a certain limit or repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.\\nInsurance\\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other\\nalternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer\\ninsurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or\\nintegrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of\\nelectricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,\\nGigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain\\nvehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows\\nus to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the\\nimpact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand\\nproduction capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding\\nlocal manufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with\\nvendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or\\nare similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple\\nsources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize\\npotential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks\\nfor components with lengthy procurement lead times.\\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by\\nmarket conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to\\nexecute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to\\nraw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and\\nproducts are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nPrograms and Incentives\\nInflation Reduction Act\\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December\\n31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and\\nenergy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up\\nto $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel\\neconomy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\\nrequirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms\\nat the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits\\ndescribed below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale\\nenergy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy\\nstorage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these\\nprograms. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a\\ncomponent of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax\\ncredit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems\\nthey purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently\\nscheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy\\nand to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or\\nresidential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where\\nwe own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are\\ncurrently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\nRegulations\\nVehicle Safety and Testing\\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal\\nMotor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and\\noccupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable\\nFMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles\\nmeet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft\\nPrevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements\\nregarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes\\ninvolving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety\\ninvestigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain\\ninformation regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel\\neconomy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car\\nAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those\\nregulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the\\nrollout of new vehicle features.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs\\nthat we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has\\npublished recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to\\ninvestigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have\\nlegal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory\\npatchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some requirements restrict the\\ndesign of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and\\nproposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S.\\nand ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.\\n10\\nTable of Contents\\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers\\nand dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile\\nmanufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform\\nwarranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.\\nIn certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative\\nprocesses to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively\\nlobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our\\nown retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-\\nion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.\\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery\\npacks are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have\\nagreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\\nSolar Energy—General\\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our\\nsystems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties,\\nsuch as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to\\ninterconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated\\nby their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available\\nunder net metering or have proposed to do so.\\nCompetition\\nAutomotive\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and\\ngrowing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the\\nelectric vehicle market.\\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For\\nexample, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3\\nand Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically\\ninclude internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers\\nhave entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and\\nvehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle\\nmarket by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have\\nelectric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are\\nalso developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\\n11\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions\\nand other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural\\nnetwork capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Systems\\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are\\nsimilar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density\\nand efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage\\nproducts give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We\\ncompete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our\\nsolar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies\\nonly install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with\\nour offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio.\\nAs part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents,\\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure\\nagreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest\\npossible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and\\ndefend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for\\ninfringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this\\npledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other\\ncompanies making electric vehicles and the world.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\\nESG\\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon\\nemissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation\\necosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one,\\nincluding with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing\\nsustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that\\nensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing\\ninto their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the\\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and\\nexternal stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our\\nincidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling,\\nimpactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a\\ngovernance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent\\nwith high principles of business ethics. Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of leaders from across our company, and regularly presents to our Board\\nof Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.\\nHuman Capital Resources\\nA competitive edge for Tesla is its ability to attract and retain high quality employees. During the past year, Tesla made substantial investments in\\nits workforce, further strengthening its standing as one of the most desirable and innovative companies to work for. As of December 31, 2023, our\\nemployee headcount worldwide was 140,473.\\nWe have created an environment that fosters growth opportunities, and as of this report, nearly two-thirds (65%) of our managers were promoted\\nfrom an internal, non-manager position, and 43% of our management employees have been with Tesla for more than five years. Tesla’s growth of 35%\\nover the past two years has offered internal career development to our employees as well as the ability to make a meaningful contribution to a\\nsustainable future.\\nWe are able to retain our employees, in part, not only because employees can enjoy ownership in Tesla through stock (of which 89% have been\\ngiven the opportunity to), but because we also provide them with excellent health benefits such as free counseling, paid parental leave, paid time off and\\nzero-premium medical plan options that are made available on the first day of employment.\\nWe recognize the positive impact that leaders can have on their teams and offer fundamental skills training and continuous development to all\\nleaders through various programs globally.\\nWe don’t stop there. Tesla has several other programs strategically designed to increase paths for greater career opportunity such as:\\n•\\nTechnician Trainee (Service) –\\u202fThe Tesla Technician Trainee Program provides on-the-job automotive maintenance training at Tesla,\\nresulting in an industry certification. Targeted at individuals with limited experience, whether in industry or vocational schools, the program\\nprepares trainees for employment as technicians. In 2023, we hired over 1,900 Technician Trainees across the U.S., Germany and China.\\n•\\nSTART (Manufacturing and Service) – Tesla START is an intensive training program that complements the Technician Trainee program and\\nequips individuals with the skills needed for a successful technician role at Tesla. We have partnered with colleges and technical academies to\\nlaunch Tesla START in the U.S., United Kingdom and Germany. In 2023, we hired over 350 trainees for manufacturing and service roles through\\nthis program, providing an opportunity to transition into full-time employment.\\n•\\nInternships – Annually, Tesla hires over 6,000 university and college students from around the world. We recruit from diverse student\\norganizations and campuses, seeking top talent passionate about our mission. Our interns engage in meaningful work from day one, and we\\noften offer them full-time positions post-internship.\\n•\\nMilitary Fellowship and Transition Programs –\\u202fThe Military Fellowship and Transition Programs are designed to offer exiting military service\\nmembers in the U.S. and Europe with career guidance on transitioning into the civil workforce. We partner with the career transition services of\\nEuropean Defence Ministries across five countries, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Hire our Heroes. These programs aim to convert\\nhigh-performing individuals to full-time roles and create a veteran talent pipeline.\\n•\\nApprenticeships – Tesla Apprenticeships are offered globally, providing academic and on-the-job training to prepare specialists in skilled\\ntrades. Apprentices will complete between one to four years of on-the-job training. Apprentice programs have seen skilled trade hires across the\\nU.S., Australia, Hong Kong, Korea and Germany.\\n•\\nManufacturing Development Program –\\u202fTesla's manufacturing pathway program is designed to provide graduating high school seniors with\\nthe financial resources, coursework and experience they need to start a successful manufacturing career at Tesla. We hired 373 graduates\\nthrough this program in 2023, and our goal in 2024 is grow this program to over 600 students annually across our Fremont Factory, Gigafactory\\nNevada, Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory New York.\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nEngineering Development Program –\\u202fLaunched in January 2024, this program targets recent college and university graduates for specialized\\nengineering fields. In collaboration with Austin Community College, the program educates early-career engineers in controls engineering,\\nenhancing their knowledge of high-demand technologies for U.S. manufacturing.\\nWe will continue to expand the opportunities for our employees to add skills and develop professionally with a new Employee Educational Assistance\\nProgram launching in the U.S. in the spring of 2024 to help employees pursue select certificates or degrees. With virtual, self-paced education options\\navailable, employees can pursue a new path or expand their knowledge while continuing to grow their career.\\nAt Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. We remain unwavering in our demand that\\nour factories, offices, stores and service centers are places where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Our policies are designed to promote\\nfairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate and promote employees based on their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be\\ntrustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance and collaborate with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These\\ninclude harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual\\norientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability or veteran status.\\nAnti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees and reoccurring for leaders. In addition, we run various\\nleadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders’ skills, and in particular, helping them to understand how to\\nappropriately respond to and address employee concerns.\\nEmployees are encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and safety concerns and can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting\\nconcerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying their Human Resource Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in\\naccordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls.\\nResponding to questions timely is key so Human Resource Partners for each functional area are visible throughout facilities and are actively involved in\\ndriving culture and engagement alongside business leaders.\\nAvailable Information\\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently\\nknown to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control\\nour manufacturing costs.\\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example,\\nwe encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and\\nwith ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique\\nmanufacturing processes and design features for our products. As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will\\nbe able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need\\nto implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances,\\nhigh quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as\\nMexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such\\nas those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve\\nmanufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our\\nproduct ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and\\nSolar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter\\ndelays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.\\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of\\nour future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we\\nmay be unable to manage these components effectively.\\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to\\nmultiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material\\ncosts, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port\\ncongestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to\\nremain solvent and operational. For example, a global shortage of semiconductors beginning in early 2021 has caused challenges in the manufacturing\\nindustry and impacted our supply chain and production. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if\\nthey are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and\\nrequire us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities,\\nproduct design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity\\nexpansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes\\nby us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may\\nface suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or\\nrequire us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may\\nexperience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure\\nadditional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly\\nor at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid\\nunfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce,\\nespecially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\\nresults.\\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high\\nvolumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of\\ncomponent purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the\\nincreased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off\\ncosts, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may\\nexperience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and\\nworkforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and\\ncommencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nto a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and\\nmaintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and\\nretention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality\\nunits at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally\\nintend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays\\nin meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement\\niterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating\\nand maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging\\nnetworks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range\\nof potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous\\ninternational variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to\\ntimely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a\\ngiven region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast\\ndemand in various markets.\\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production\\nvolumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets\\nrequiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and\\ntouchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we\\nare working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized\\nprofessionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability\\nof our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts\\ninventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and\\nconnectors throughout the world.\\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets\\nglobally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure\\nnetwork will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that\\nthey will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to\\nsupport them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale,\\ninstallation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to\\nmanage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and manufacture of\\nour own cells, and control our related costs.\\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially\\nmore cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.\\nLimited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing\\nsuppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long\\nterm, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater\\nvolumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and\\nmay continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we\\nhave planned or at all. If we are\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at\\npotentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and\\navailability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be\\nunstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric\\nvehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be\\nwilling or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced\\navailability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot\\nrecoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth,\\nprospects and operating results.\\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an\\nautomotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in\\nparticular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles\\ncompete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively\\naffected by numerous factors, such as:\\n•\\nperceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\\n•\\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;\\n•\\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion\\nengine vehicles;\\n•\\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\\n•\\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\\n•\\nconcerns about our future viability.\\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets,\\nwhich may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer\\ndemand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and\\nattempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.\\nRising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and\\noperating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate\\nwith such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\\nmay be harmed.\\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A significant and growing\\nnumber of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market\\nfor electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology\\nand other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as\\nChina and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain\\ngovernment and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater\\nbenefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established\\nresources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased\\ncompetition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm\\nour business, financial condition and operating results.\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of\\ncompeting energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable\\nenergy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\\nRisks Related to Our Operations\\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the\\nproduction and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production,\\nincluding by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and\\npacks and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or\\nif we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be\\nlimited, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our\\nvarious facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety\\nprocedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations.\\nAny such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\\nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain\\nregulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous\\njurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our\\noperations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety\\nrequirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business\\nlocations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights;\\ntrade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products.\\nFor example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to\\nsell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to\\nbecome fully functional.\\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed\\nor intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD Capability features take longer than expected to\\nbecome enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be\\nharmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection\\nclaims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products’ capability and performance,\\nthere is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial\\nfunctional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues\\nwe observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy\\nour customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry,\\nwe currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance\\ncharacteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-\\nproduction and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to\\nor installation for customers.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our\\nvehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we\\nexpect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD\\nCapability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports\\nregarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and\\nregulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In\\naddition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain\\nby venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to\\npassively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our\\nvehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy\\nstorage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may\\nsubject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of\\nwhich may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product\\nliability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings\\nagencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited\\noperating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing,\\ndelivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services;\\nour quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In\\nparticular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of\\ncommentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the\\nsufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more\\ndifficult to raise additional funds if needed.\\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various\\nfinancing programs.\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions.\\nWe also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such\\narrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small\\nportion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various\\narrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or\\npurchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and\\nconsumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’\\nresidual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and\\ndemand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments\\nto our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our\\nvehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are\\nunable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs\\nare not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle\\nleasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nSimilarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such\\ncounterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values are subject to\\nfluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above. If the actual resale values of any\\nvehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial\\ncondition and operating results may be harmed.\\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In\\nthe event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations\\nto us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with\\nrespect to the underlying assets.\\nWe must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York\\nrelating to our Gigafactory New York.\\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”).\\nThese agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of\\nour Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved\\nfunctions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel\\nin the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and\\nother costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2023, we are currently in\\nexcess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo. While we expect to have and grow significant\\noperations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet\\nall applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the\\ntermination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\\nAny of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the\\ndevelopment, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of\\nTesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to\\nsuccessfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and\\nretain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to\\nsupport our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing\\nthese risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented\\nindividuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations,\\nparticularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including\\nspecialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and\\nprosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth\\nopportunities.\\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in\\norder to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for\\nfuture increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite\\nstockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire\\nqualified personnel may be harmed.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant\\ntime with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief\\nExecutive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chairman\\nand Chief Technical Officer of X Corp., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-\\nattacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory\\ninvestigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory\\nmanagement, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This\\nincludes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain\\ninformation technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-\\nattacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service\\nattacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns,\\ndamage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional\\nactions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or\\ndissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any\\nof these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time\\nconsuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness\\nof database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and\\nsecurity of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on\\nour business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management\\nsoftware provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems\\nhave not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption\\nto, our or our service providers’ systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third\\nparties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost,\\nand there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating\\ncurrent systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory,\\nprocure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain\\ncompliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to\\naccurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which\\nmay impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information,\\ncould be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we\\nexpect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in\\ndata connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security\\nmeasures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have\\nreportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain\\ncontrol of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our\\nproducts. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we\\naim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can\\nbe identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations.\\nIn addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in\\nthe perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been\\nthe subject of such reports in the past.\\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and\\nincreased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective\\nbargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently\\nto provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be\\nrequired to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which\\nsuch unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future.\\nAny unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are\\ndirectly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or\\nstrikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from\\nvarious hardware and software-related safety concerns or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing\\nof or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative\\npublic perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we\\nmay voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant\\nwith applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by\\nsystems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service\\nburdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with\\nrespect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us,\\nwe generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the\\nlife of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\\nguarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the\\ncontract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some\\ncases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease\\noperations or fail to honor their warranties.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be\\nharmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based\\non actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and\\nchanges to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to\\nproduce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us,\\nfor which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in\\nsome cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy\\nlimitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss\\nthat is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our\\nability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In\\naddition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to\\nchanges in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted.\\nFurthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to\\naccelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate\\nsubstantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or\\nthrough obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our\\ncurrent or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our\\nsignificant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be\\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of\\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may\\nchange periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in\\nengineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed\\nequipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed\\nequipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened,\\ncausing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur\\nadditional indebtedness.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt,\\nto the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our\\nvulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our\\nexisting and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or\\nrepurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future\\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash\\nflow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to\\nmake necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as\\nreducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous\\nor highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In\\naddition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not\\nbe able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our\\nfinancial condition and operating results.\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses\\nand localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such\\nforeign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically\\nexperienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be,\\ndenominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates\\nsignificantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins\\nwill suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be\\ntime-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business.\\nOur competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or\\ninterfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business.\\nFrom time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging\\ninfringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries,\\nmaking it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the\\nconfidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.\\nThe theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position.\\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in\\nthese circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are\\nstrategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into\\nlicensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\nlitigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to\\nhave or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making,\\nselling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license\\nroyalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we\\nare required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may result in\\nadditional costs or risks.\\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor\\nadvocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in\\nrecent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition\\nto sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur\\nadditional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics.\\nWe may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or\\nother events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern\\nCalifornia and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located\\nexperienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as\\nearthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our\\nheadquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition,\\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly\\nevery geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Also, the broader\\nconsequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts;\\nairspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against\\ncompanies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such\\nevents outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nRisks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the\\ndevelopment and adoption of such products.\\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax\\nexemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives\\nfavoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or\\nreinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended\\nto provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such\\ndevelopments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing\\nmodifications.\\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy\\nstorage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.\\nHowever, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase,\\nsometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy\\nthat their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been\\nor has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before\\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\\noperating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract\\ninvestment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair\\nmarket values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined\\nthat these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our\\nobligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.\\nWe are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes\\nupon our operations or products.\\nAs we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and\\nsafety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use,\\nhandling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with\\nrespect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could\\nalso lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and\\nany failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nincreased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government\\ninvestigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it\\nmay harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations\\napplicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries\\noutside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from\\nequivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries.\\nThis process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with\\nforeign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and\\npotentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to\\ndevelop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may\\nadversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including\\nfull self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to\\napply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork\\nof complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely\\naffect our business.\\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity\\ngenerated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual\\npower plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity\\npricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-\\nowned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance\\nor use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and\\nservices, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant\\njurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy,\\ndata protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable\\ninformation could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other\\nsignificant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an\\nunsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from\\nand defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and\\nmay require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or\\nattractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection\\nRegulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection\\nmeasures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing\\nfederal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on\\nour use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in\\nChina.\\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may\\ncause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal\\nliability.\\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to\\ncybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could\\ninclude ongoing audit requirements, data protection\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nauthority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other\\ncommercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be\\nrequired to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal\\ninformation of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and handle. A major breach of\\nour network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects\\nand operating results.\\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain\\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings.\\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has\\nconcluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility\\nthat we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any\\nother government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information\\nand subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our\\nvehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales\\nmodel. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such\\nassertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations\\nand others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such\\nresults have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers\\nanywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted,\\nwould prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability\\nto operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable\\nto our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may\\nrestrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and\\nmay change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm\\nour financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors,\\nsome of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $299.29 per share and a\\nlow of $152.37 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume\\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our\\ncommon stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common\\nstock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may\\nadditionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating\\nperformance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation\\nhas been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial\\ncosts and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we\\ncontinue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and\\nadding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce\\nexisting products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-\\nquarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied\\nupon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or\\ninvestors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially,\\neither suddenly or over time.\\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price\\nto decline.\\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting\\nbusiness conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past\\nbeen inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those\\nrelating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and\\ncommodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on\\nour financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\\nIf Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations,\\nor in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase\\nshares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings\\nand placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr.\\nMusk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of\\nTesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock\\nto decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to\\nsell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a\\ntakeover attempt.\\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an\\nacquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law\\nthat limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may\\nrequire us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and\\nterms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares\\nof our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNone.\\n28\\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in\\nItem 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees\\nor customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our\\nbusiness, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party\\nassessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we,\\namong other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration\\ntesting using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability\\nreporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer\\nproducts) and implement appropriate changes.\\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1)\\npreparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident\\nanalysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding\\nmatters of cybersecurity.\\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to\\ndetermine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with\\ntechnical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation\\nstrategies.\\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and\\ncompliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2023, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the\\nrequirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third\\nparties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated\\nwhen determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing\\nour employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity\\ncompromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have\\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the\\nheading “Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other\\nsecurity incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability,\\nreputational damage and other adverse consequences” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCybersecurity Governance\\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is\\nresponsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior\\nmanagement, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This\\nincludes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy\\nincidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on\\ncybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\\n29\\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance\\nand Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including\\nsecurity, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and\\nremediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes\\ndescribed above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.\\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1-\\nBusiness. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2022-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7.\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022, which was\\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 31, 2023.\\nOverview and 2023 Highlights\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully\\nelectric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance,\\nfinancial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence,\\nrobotics and automation.\\nIn 2023, we produced 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,808,581 consumer vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle\\nproduction, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and\\nlocalizing our supply chain, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new\\nproducts to market and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\\nIn 2023, we deployed 14.72 GWh of energy storage products and 223 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping\\nproduction of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy\\nsystems.\\nIn 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77 billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp\\nproduction, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in\\nresearch and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\\nIn 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44 billion, compared to the\\nprior year. This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. We continue\\nto focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.\\nWe ended 2023 with $29.09 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $6.91 billion from the end of 2022.\\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 and 2022 were $13.26 billion and $14.72 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.47\\nbillion. Capital expenditures amounted to $8.90 billion in 2023, compared to $7.16 billion in 2022, representing an increase of $1.74 billion. Sustained\\ngrowth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and\\ndevelopment in upcoming periods.\\n33\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\\nAutomotive—Production\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the\\ndate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\\nProduction Location\\nVehicle Model(s)\\nProduction Status\\nFremont Factory\\nModel S / Model X\\nActive\\n \\nModel 3 / Model Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Shanghai\\nModel 3 / Model Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\\nModel Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Texas\\nModel Y\\nActive\\n \\nCybertruck\\nActive\\nGigafactory Nevada\\nTesla Semi\\nPilot production\\nVarious\\nNext Generation Platform\\nIn development\\nTBD\\nTesla Roadster\\nIn development\\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and\\nnext generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and\\nefficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our\\nnext generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in\\nproduction volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our\\nplans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability\\nand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’\\nperformance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features\\nand delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\\noperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current\\nchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These\\nmacroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our\\noperating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust\\naccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest\\nfactories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will\\nhelp enable future growth.\\n34\\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our\\ntotal deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the\\ncost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and\\ncharging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer\\nsatisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and\\nagreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer\\ndemands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of\\nour energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our\\nMegafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of\\nspecific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering\\nexperience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we\\nwill have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled\\nelectricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time,\\nand may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping\\nmanufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger\\nnetwork and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending\\non overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital\\nefficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all\\nother continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital\\nmanagement resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash\\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\\nprovide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain\\nand labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as\\nlong as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The\\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions\\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\\nAccordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\\nongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,\\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\\n35\\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\\nreserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of\\nfinancial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have\\nassessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially\\naffected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\\n606”), including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-\\nair software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration\\nfor expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when\\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information\\nthat may be available.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n36\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee\\nstock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock\\noption awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our\\ncommon stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\\nincome taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely\\nthan not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted\\nfor permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in\\nrecent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected\\nfuture results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our\\ncommon stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in\\nbusiness that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of\\nfuture results considering all available information.\\n37\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and\\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes\\npayable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in\\neffect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to\\nour tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\\nexperience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations,\\nsuch differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\\nResults of Operations\\nRevenues\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\\n2022 vs. 2021 Change\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n$\\n%\\n$\\n%\\nAutomotive sales\\n$\\n78,509 \\n$\\n67,210 \\n$\\n44,125 \\n$\\n11,299 \\n17 %\\n$\\n23,085 \\n52 %\\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\n1,790 \\n1,776 \\n1,465 \\n14 \\n1 %\\n311 \\n21 %\\nAutomotive leasing\\n2,120 \\n2,476 \\n1,642 \\n(356)\\n(14)%\\n834 \\n51 %\\nTotal automotive revenues\\n82,419 \\n71,462 \\n47,232 \\n10,957 \\n15 %\\n24,230 \\n51 %\\nServices and other\\n8,319 \\n6,091 \\n3,802 \\n2,228 \\n37 %\\n2,289 \\n60 %\\nTotal automotive & services and other segment\\nrevenue\\n90,738 \\n77,553 \\n51,034 \\n13,185 \\n17 %\\n26,519 \\n52 %\\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue\\n6,035 \\n3,909 \\n2,789 \\n2,126 \\n54 %\\n1,120 \\n40 %\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n96,773 \\n$\\n81,462 \\n$\\n53,823 \\n$\\n15,311 \\n19 %\\n$\\n27,639 \\n51 %\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, Model Y, and\\nCybertruck vehicles, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs\\nand over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory\\ncredits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles\\nare sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or\\nchanges in regulation impacting the credits.\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements.

Cost of automotive sales revenue increased in line with the change in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. The increase\\nwas partially offset by a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily due to sales mix, lower inbound freight, a decrease in\\nmaterial costs and lower manufacturing costs from better fixed cost absorption. Our costs of revenue were also positively impacted by the United States\\ndollar strengthening against our foreign currencies as compared to the prior periods and by the IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current year.\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $241 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year.\\nCost of services and other revenue increased $1.95 billion, or 33%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022.

The decrease was primarily due to a lower average selling price on our vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in our\\naverage combined cost per unit of our vehicles and IRA manufacturing credits earned as discussed above.\\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.5% to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as\\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense,\\nother overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write\\ndown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess\\nof forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar\\nenergy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems,\\nmaintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n2023 compared to 2022\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.27 billion, or 35%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2022, in line with the increase in Megapack deployments year over year, as discussed above. This increase was partially offset by an\\nimprovement in production ramping that drove down the average cost per MWh of Megapack as well as IRA manufacturing credits earned during the\\ncurrent year.\\n40\\nGross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 7.4% to 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by an improvement in our Megapack gross margin from lower average cost per MWh and a higher\\nproportion of Megapack, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment as compared to the prior year periods.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and\\nverifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state\\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\\nassets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. Approximately $5.93 billion of the total valuation allowance release was related to\\ndeferred tax assets to be realized in the future years and the remainder benefited us during the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to maintain\\na full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to\\nbe realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets generation in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\\nOur (benefit from) provision for income taxes changed by $6.13 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax\\nassets.\\nOur effective tax rate changed from an expense of 8% to a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance regarding our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets.\\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last five fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core\\noperations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our\\nproprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued\\nexpansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation\\ncapabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\\n42\\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our\\ncapital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly\\nthan expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures.\\nFinally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid\\ngrowth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time\\ndetermine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31,\\n2023, as well as in the long-term.\\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such\\nneeds.\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to\\nbe used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and\\nproduction ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts\\nbeyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an\\nagreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through\\nDecember 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was memorialized\\nin an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments\\nand Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.98\\nbillion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, our total minimum lease payments was $5.96 billion, of which\\n$1.31 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note 12,\\nLeases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and\\ninstallations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $16.40 billion and $12.70 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances\\nheld in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $4.43 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.03 billion of unused\\ncommitted credit amounts as of December 31, 2023. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments,\\nto do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.\\n43\\nSummary of Cash Flows\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$\\n13,256 \\n$\\n14,724 \\n$\\n11,497 \\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$\\n(15,584)\\n$\\n(11,973)\\n$\\n(7,868)\\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\\n$\\n2,589 \\n$\\n(3,527)\\n$\\n(5,203)\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as\\nresearch and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and\\nrelated servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage\\nproducts, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials\\nand parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.47 billion to $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 from $14.72 billion\\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses\\nof $2.93 billion, partially offset by favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.46 billion.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $8.90 billion for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly for global factory expansion and machinery and\\nequipment as we expand our product roadmap. We also purchased $6.62 billion and $5.81 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and\\nsales, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, proceeds from sales of digital assets was $936 million in the year\\nended December 31, 2022.\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash from financing activities changed by $6.12 billion to $2.59 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023 from $3.53 billion net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to a\\n$3.93 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $2.01 billion decrease in repayments of debt. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\n44\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating\\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general,\\nwe are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating\\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-\\nmeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and\\ncash and cash equivalents balances).\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and\\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on\\nour net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023 and $473 million at\\nDecember 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\\n45\\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChanges in Accounting Principles\\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2021.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\\nOur audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\\nbasis for our opinions.\\n47\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\\neffect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $5,152\\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for\\nthese products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified.\\nThese estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are\\nthe significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant\\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency\\nand costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the automotive warranty\\nreserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of\\nfuture claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one\\nof the following: (i) testing management’s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an\\nindependent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management’s\\nestimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management’s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant\\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the\\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating\\nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred.\\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims\\nwere appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in\\ndeveloping an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain\\naspects of management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 26,

(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we\\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary\\ncourse of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our\\ndirect vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC\\n810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits\\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not\\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity\\nArrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,\\ndetermining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts\\nand finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\\naccompanying notes.\\n54\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue by source\\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAutomotive sales\\n$\\n78,509 \\n$\\n67,210 \\n$\\n44,125 \\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\n1,790 \\n1,776 \\n1,465 \\nEnergy generation and storage sales\\n5,515 \\n3,376 \\n2,279 \\nServices and other\\n8,319 \\n6,091 \\n3,802 \\nTotal revenues from sales and services\\n94,133 \\n78,453 \\n51,671 \\nAutomotive leasing\\n2,120 \\n2,476 \\n1,642 \\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\\n520 \\n533 \\n510 \\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n96,773 \\n$\\n81,462 \\n$\\n53,823 \\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet\\nconnectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,\\nwhich is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return\\nreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback\\nterms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are\\nprovisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We\\nrecognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\\nRevenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized\\nover time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales\\nrevenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to\\nautomotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to\\nshipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\\nvehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\n55\\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs,\\nwe originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the\\ntransaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the\\nlease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s contract residual value at the end\\nof the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been\\nchanges to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as\\nmarket conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles sold under this program was\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging\\nprograms and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nDeferred revenue— beginning of period\\n$\\n2,913 \\n$\\n2,382 \\nAdditions\\n1,201 \\n1,178 \\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\\n17 \\n(67)\\nRevenue recognized\\n(595)\\n(580)\\nDeferred revenue— end of period\\n$\\n3,536 \\n$\\n2,913 \\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as\\nof the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $469 million for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023. We had recognized revenue of $472 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021, for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred\\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize $926 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be\\nrecognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have\\nrecorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $242 million and $128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts\\nreceivable, net, for the current portion and $1.04 billion and $665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term\\nportion.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and\\nclean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment\\nterms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated\\nwith them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory\\ncredits was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\\nwas immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in\\nrevenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\\n56\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying\\ncustomers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to\\nreturn the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458 million and $407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases\\n(“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to\\nus during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease\\nterm after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be\\nexercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual\\npayments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-\\ntype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest\\nincome based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue\\nand $164 million, $427 million and $234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell\\nused vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle\\ncomponents, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary\\nto the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within\\nCustomer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from\\ncustomers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue\\nexcluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n57\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small\\ncommercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,\\ncustomers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time\\nusing the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy\\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system\\nwill meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the\\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $1.60 billion and $863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the\\ndeferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $571 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nrespectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance\\nobligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to\\ninvoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to\\nperformance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.43\\nbillion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $1.05 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nwe have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $31 million and $24 million, respectively, is recorded within\\nAccounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $578 million and $387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-\\nterm portion.\\n58\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease\\nrevenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the\\nlease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is\\nrecorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these\\nagreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity\\ndelivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized,\\nwhich is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $181 million and $191 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives\\nreceived from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.\\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales\\ncommissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\\nCost of Revenues\\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling\\nand machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD Capability ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and\\ninfrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes\\nadjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to\\nprovide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing\\ncredits earned.\\nAutomotive Leasing\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases\\nand warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\\nServices and Other\\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty\\nafter-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for\\nretail merchandise.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, overhead costs, freight, warranty expense, and\\namortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value\\nof our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\\nAdditionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and\\nPPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs\\nassociated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n59\\nResearch and Development Costs\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under\\nwhich deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities\\nusing enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when\\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is\\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\\ndeferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual\\nearnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary\\ndifferences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.\\nOur valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\\nUnder GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such\\namounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nComprehensive Income\\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign\\ncurrency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee\\nservices received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is\\nestimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the\\nrisk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of\\nRSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during\\nwhich an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options\\nand RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\n60\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\\narrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined\\nthat the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a\\nbalance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling\\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV\\nmethod, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the\\namounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets\\nof the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\\ndistributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling\\ninterest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after\\ntaking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least\\nequal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the\\nconsolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there\\nhave been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due\\nto changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been reached.\\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common\\nstockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-\\naverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or\\nthe if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders\\nwhen their effect is dilutive.\\nFurthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11,\\nDebt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The\\nstrike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the\\nweighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and\\ndiluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n14,997 \\n$\\n12,556 \\n$\\n5,519 \\nLess: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest\\n(2)\\n(27)\\n(5)\\nNet income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock\\n14,999 \\n12,583 \\n5,524 \\nLess: Dilutive convertible debt\\n— \\n(1)\\n(9)\\nNet income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock\\n$\\n14,999 \\n$\\n12,584 \\n$\\n5,533 \\n61\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common\\nstock attributable to common stockholders (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock,\\nbasic\\n3,174\\n3,130\\n2,959\\nAdd:\\nStock-based awards\\n298\\n310\\n292\\nConvertible senior notes\\n2\\n3\\n29\\nWarrants\\n11\\n32\\n106\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock,\\ndiluted\\n3,485\\n3,475\\n3,386\\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common\\nstock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nStock-based awards\\n12\\n4\\n1\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the\\nfair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the\\nacquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and\\nnoncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the\\ntotal purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of\\nthe identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling\\ninterests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash\\nequivalents are primarily comprised of U.S. government securities, money market funds and commercial paper.\\nRestricted Cash\\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain\\npayments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value\\nguarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\\n62\\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n16,398 \\n$\\n16,253 \\n$\\n17,576 \\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets\\n543 \\n294 \\n345 \\nRestricted cash included in other non-current assets\\n248 \\n377 \\n223 \\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows\\n$\\n17,189 \\n$\\n16,924 \\n$\\n18,144 \\nInvestments\\nInvestments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, including U.S. government securities, corporate debt securities,\\ncommercial paper, time deposits, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value,\\nwith unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale\\nmarketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest\\nincome in our consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-\\nsale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the\\ndecline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our\\ninvestments approximates its fair value.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing\\nproducts to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and\\ngovernment rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be\\nuncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for\\ncertain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to\\napproximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of\\nregulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected\\ndepending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our\\naccounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $207 million and $753 million, respectively, of long-term\\ngovernment rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nFinancing Receivables\\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of\\nallowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels\\nconsidered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level\\nof credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.\\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score)\\nand other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant\\ncredit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\\n63\\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing\\nreceivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an immaterial balance being past due. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of\\nDecember 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022.\\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the\\npurchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for\\nexpected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current\\nportion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total outstanding balance of MyPower\\ncustomer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $266 million and $280 million, respectively, of which $5 million and $7 million\\nwere due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for expected credit\\nlosses was $36 million and $37 million, respectively.\\nConcentration of Risk\\nCredit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash,\\naccounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions\\nor invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no entity represented\\n10% or more of our total receivables balance.\\nSupply Risk\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our\\nproducts in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these\\nsuppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\nOperating Lease Vehicles\\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the\\ncontractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.36 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively.\\nOperating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.38 billion and $1.04 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n64\\nDigital Assets, Net\\nWe currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. We\\nhave ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at\\ncost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.\\nWe determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), based\\non quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each\\nquarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more\\nlikely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of\\ndigital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair\\nvalue determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their\\ncarrying values and the prices determined.\\nImpairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment\\nis identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets\\nheld within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying\\nvalue of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nSolar energy systems in service\\n30 to 35 years\\nInitial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs\\nLease term (up to 25 years)\\nSolar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and\\nplaced in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy\\nsystems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement\\nacquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\\ngenerally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture\\n3 to 15 years\\nTooling\\n4 to 7 years\\nBuilding and building improvements\\n15 to 30 years\\nComputer equipment and software\\n3 to 10 years\\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the\\nconsolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures\\nare expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated\\nratably over the identified useful life.\\n65\\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in\\nprogress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events\\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by\\ncomparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying\\namount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we have recognized no material impairments\\nof our long-lived assets.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years.\\nGoodwill\\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be\\nimpaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we did not\\nrecognize any impairment of goodwill.\\nCapitalization of Software Costs\\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and\\nequipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\\nincurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.\\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the\\nestablishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become\\nsignificant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur\\nthat could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we have recognized no impairments of\\ncapitalized software costs.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary\\ncurrency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by\\nthe different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional\\nexchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other\\nthan the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $122 million,\\nloss of $89 million and gain of $97 million, respectively.\\n66\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty\\nactivity consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\\n$\\n3,505 \\n$\\n2,101 \\n$\\n1,468 \\nWarranty costs incurred\\n(1,225)\\n(803)\\n(525)\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign\\nexchange impact\\n539 \\n522 \\n102 \\nProvision for warranty\\n2,333 \\n1,685 \\n1,056 \\nAccrued warranty—end of period\\n$\\n5,152 \\n$\\n3,505 \\n$\\n2,101 \\nCustomer Deposits\\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an\\nenergy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on\\ncontracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and\\nother on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.\\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives\\nare recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset.\\nThe benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable\\nassurance of their receipt.\\nThe IRA Incentives\\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple\\nincentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative\\nminimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to\\nmaterially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a\\nreduction of our material costs in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IRA as more guidance is issued\\nand the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements.\\n67\\nGigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease\\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related\\nresearch and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants,\\nincluding hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction\\ncosts related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any\\nconstruction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease\\ncosts of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nGigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we\\nare required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai\\ngovernment has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at\\nGigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received grant funding of $76\\nmillion. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property,\\nplant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of\\nthe related equipment.\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that\\nprovide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of\\ncapital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we\\nwould receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle\\nIndependent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case\\nsubject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is\\nrecorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements\\nof operations. As of December 31, 2023, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial.\\nDefined Contribution Plan\\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue\\nCode and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their\\neligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a\\nmaximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31,\\n2023 and 2022, we recognized $99 million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\\n68\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\n(Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are\\nregularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also\\nrequires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a\\nsegment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to\\nall prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required\\ndisclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain\\ncrypto assets to be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other\\nintangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto holding. The ASU is\\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a\\ncumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the\\namendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity\\nmust adopt the ASU as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU will result in gains and losses recorded in the\\nconsolidated financial statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it will\\naffect the carrying value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, once adopted.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated\\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not\\nyet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial\\nstatements, once adopted.\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic\\n805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from\\nacquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had\\noriginated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal\\nyears. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance\\nfor troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted\\non January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is\\nexperiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-\\noffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods\\nbeginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU\\nhas not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n69\\nASU 2020-06\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies\\nthe accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for\\nconvertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives\\nunder Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no\\nlonger required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized\\ncost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when\\napplying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the\\nmost significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share\\nsettlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies\\nfor a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or\\nliabilities.\\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $211 million cumulative effect of\\ninitially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity\\nconversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $474 million and convertible senior notes\\n(mezzanine equity) was reduced by $51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of\\nincreasing our net debt balance by $269 million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45 million related to previously capitalized interest.\\nThe prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in\\neffect for those periods.\\nNote 3 – Digital Assets, Net\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets. During the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment losses on digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded\\n$204 million of impairment losses on digital assets and realized gains of $64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat\\ncurrency. The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31,\\n2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our digital assets held reflects cumulative impairment of $204 million.\\nNote 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill increased $59 million within the automotive segment from $194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $253 million as of December 31, 2023\\nprimarily from a business combination, net of the impact of a divestiture. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2023 and\\n2022.\\nThe net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $215 million as of December 31, 2022 to $178 million as of December 31, 2023\\nmainly from amortization.\\nNote 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an\\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should\\nbe determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\\nII) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is\\nlittle or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As\\nthe terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production\\ncommences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes,\\nexcept production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property,\\nplant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on\\nPanasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated\\nproductive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $2.02 billion and $2.01 billion,\\nrespectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.\\n73\\nNote 9 – Accrued Liabilities and Other\\nOur accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAccrued purchases (1)\\n$\\n2,721 \\n$\\n2,747 \\nAccrued warranty reserve, current portion\\n1,546 \\n1,025 \\nPayroll and related costs\\n1,325 \\n1,026 \\nTaxes payable (2)\\n1,204 \\n1,235 \\nCustomer deposits\\n876 \\n1,063 \\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion\\n672 \\n485 \\nSales return reserve, current portion\\n219 \\n270 \\nOther current liabilities\\n517 \\n354 \\nTotal\\n$\\n9,080 \\n$\\n8,205 \\n(1)\\nAccrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for which we had not yet been invoiced.

Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our\\nsubsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As\\nof December 31, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.\\n2024 Notes\\nThe closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30\\nconsecutive trading days of each quarter in 2023, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. As of December\\n31, 2023, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $406 million. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled\\nin cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.\\nCredit Agreement\\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a\\nsyndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus\\n0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain\\nof our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain\\nreserves.\\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to\\nreplace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total\\ncommitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for\\ngeneral corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR\\n(the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the\\nsterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case,\\nplus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit\\nRating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\\n75\\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose\\nentities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial\\nstatements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-\\nbacked Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the\\nassociated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to\\nour other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\\nIn 2023, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and financing receivables into SPEs and issued $3.93 billion in\\naggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The\\nproceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $3.92 billion.\\nCash Equity Debt\\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that\\nbears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.\\nAutomotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities\\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we terminated our Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities and the previously committed funds are no longer\\navailable for future borrowings.\\nPledged Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had pledged or restricted $4.64 billion and $2.02 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating\\nlease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.\\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nRecourse debt\\nNon-recourse debt\\nTotal\\n2024\\n$\\n37 \\n$\\n1,941 \\n$\\n1,978 \\n2025\\n4 \\n1,663 \\n1,667 \\n2026\\n— \\n494 \\n494 \\n2027\\n— \\n276 \\n276 \\n2028\\n— \\n44 \\n44 \\nThereafter\\n3 \\n221 \\n224 \\nTotal\\n$\\n44 \\n$\\n4,639 \\n$\\n4,683 \\nNote 12 – Leases\\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and\\nservice locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a\\nlease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made\\navailable for use by the lessor.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-\\nlease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type\\nleases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for\\nthe non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating\\nlease.\\n76\\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease\\ninception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are\\nrecognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an\\nimplicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the\\npresent value of lease payments.\\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to\\nterminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or\\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending\\non the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the\\npresent value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated\\nlease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues\\nor operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within\\nInterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance\\nsheets:\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nOperating leases:\\n \\n \\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n4,180 \\n$\\n2,563 \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other\\n$\\n672 \\n$\\n485 \\nOther long-term liabilities\\n3,671 \\n2,164 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n4,343 \\n$\\n2,649 \\n \\nFinance leases:\\n \\n \\nSolar energy systems, net\\n$\\n23 \\n$\\n25 \\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\\n601 \\n1,094 \\nTotal finance lease assets\\n$\\n624 \\n$\\n1,119 \\n \\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance leases\\n$\\n398 \\n$\\n486 \\nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion\\n175 \\n568 \\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n573 \\n$\\n1,054 \\n77\\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nOperating lease expense:\\n \\n \\n \\nOperating lease expense (1)\\n$\\n1,153 \\n$\\n798 \\n$\\n627 \\n \\nFinance lease expense:\\nAmortization of leased assets\\n$\\n506 \\n$\\n493 \\n$\\n415 \\nInterest on lease liabilities\\n45 \\n72 \\n89 \\nTotal finance lease expense\\n$\\n551 \\n$\\n565 \\n$\\n504 \\n \\nTotal lease expense\\n$\\n1,704 \\n$\\n1,363 \\n$\\n1,131 \\n(1)\\nIncludes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial.\\nOther information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\\nOperating leases\\n7.4 years\\n6.4 years\\nFinance leases\\n2.3 years\\n3.1 years\\n \\nWeighted-average discount rate:\\nOperating leases\\n5.6 %\\n5.3 %\\nFinance leases\\n5.5 %\\n5.7 %\\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases\\n$\\n1,084 \\n$\\n754 \\n$\\n616 \\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments)\\n$\\n47 \\n$\\n75 \\n$\\n89 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n10 \\n$\\n58 \\n$\\n486 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n2,170 \\n$\\n1,059 \\n$\\n818 \\n78\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions):\\n \\nOperating\\nLeases\\nFinance\\nLeases\\n2024\\n$\\n892 \\n$\\n418 \\n2025\\n831 \\n81 \\n2026\\n706 \\n57 \\n2027\\n603 \\n38 \\n2028\\n508 \\n2 \\nThereafter\\n1,820 \\n4 \\nTotal minimum lease payments\\n5,360 \\n600 \\nLess: Interest\\n1,017 \\n27 \\nPresent value of lease obligations\\n4,343 \\n573 \\nLess: Current portion\\n672 \\n398 \\nLong-term portion of lease obligations\\n$\\n3,671 \\n$\\n175 \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have excluded from the table above additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent\\npayments of $1.53 billion.

The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock,\\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the\\n2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees.\\nNonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and\\nour stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or\\nconsulting relationship ends.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, 131.1 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.\\n80\\nThe following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\\nStock Options\\nRSUs\\nNumber of\\nOptions\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nExercise\\nPrice\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nRemaining\\nContractual\\nLife (years)\\nAggregate\\nIntrinsic\\nValue\\n(in billions)\\nNumber\\nof RSUs\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant\\nDate Fair\\nValue\\nBeginning of period\\n343,564\\n$\\n30.65 \\n21,333\\n$\\n162.32 \\nGranted\\n9,521\\n$\\n226.50 \\n11,743\\n$\\n228.33 \\nExercised or released\\n(7,626)\\n$\\n43.07 \\n(11,085)\\n$\\n116.47 \\nCancelled\\n(1,438)\\n$\\n194.23 \\n(2,903)\\n$\\n192.22 \\nEnd of period\\n344,021\\n$\\n35.11 \\n4.31\\n$\\n73.57 \\n19,088\\n$\\n225.01 \\nVested and expected to vest, December 31, 2023\\n340,884\\n$\\n33.38 \\n4.27\\n$\\n73.45 \\n18,446\\n$\\n225.76 \\nExercisable and vested, December 31, 2023\\n329,124\\n$\\n27.07 \\n4.11\\n$\\n72.90 \\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $228.33, $239.85 and\\n$261.33, respectively. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2.50 billion, $4.32\\nbillion and $5.70 billion, respectively.\\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.33 billion, $1.90 billion and\\n$26.88 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO\\nPerformance Award, which amounted to an intrinsic value of $23.45 billion.\\nESPP\\nOur employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any\\nplan limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering\\nperiod. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, under the ESPP we issued 2.1 million, 1.4 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 97.8 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\\nFair Value Assumptions\\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each\\nstock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing\\nmodel. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nRisk-free interest rate\\n3.90 %\\n3.11 %\\n0.66 %\\nExpected term (in years)\\n4.5\\n4.1\\n4.3\\nExpected volatility\\n63 %\\n63 %\\n59 %\\nDividend yield\\n0.0 %\\n0.0 %\\n0.0 %\\nGrant date fair value per share\\n$\\n121.62 \\n$\\n114.51 \\n$\\n128.02 \\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of\\nour common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each\\ngrant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average\\nof the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\\n81\\n2018 CEO Performance Award\\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 304.0 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020\\nStock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 vesting\\ntranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions,\\nassuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each\\nof the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization\\nmilestone for such tranche, which began at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six\\ncalendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), had been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following\\neight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA had been achieved for\\nthe four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms\\n10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA was defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for\\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of\\n$23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years\\npost-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2023 is provided below.\\nTotal Annualized Revenue\\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\\nMilestone\\n(in billions)\\nAchievement Status\\nMilestone\\n(in billions)\\nAchievement Status\\n$\\n20.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n1.5 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n35.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n3.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n55.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n4.5 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n75.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n6.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n100.0 \\n-\\n$\\n8.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n125.0 \\n-\\n$\\n10.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n150.0 \\n-\\n$\\n12.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n175.0 \\n-\\n$\\n14.0 \\nAchieved\\nStock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represented a non-cash expense and was recorded as a Selling, general, and\\nadministrative operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we\\nhad recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponded to the\\nnumber of operational milestones that had been achieved or had been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the\\nfollowing principles.\\nOn the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the\\nfuture time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone\\nachievement time.” Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter, we determined whether it was\\nprobable that we would achieve each operational milestone that had not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the\\nfuture time when we expected to achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.”\\nAs of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award had been\\nrecognized. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $66 million and $910 million,\\nrespectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\n82\\nOther Performance-Based Grants\\nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $655 million under these grants to purchase or receive an\\naggregate 5.3 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation\\nexpense of $110 million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $57 million and $159 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense\\nrelated to these grants, net of forfeitures.\\nSummary Stock-Based Compensation Information\\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCost of revenues\\n$\\n741 \\n$\\n594 \\n$\\n421 \\nResearch and development\\n689 \\n536 \\n448 \\nSelling, general and administrative\\n382 \\n430 \\n1,252 \\nTotal\\n$\\n1,812 \\n$\\n1,560 \\n$\\n2,121 \\nOur income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements were immaterial while we were under full valuation allowances\\non our U.S. deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the release of the valuation allowance associated with our\\nfederal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023, income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense were $326 million during\\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our\\nconsolidated balance sheets was $199 million, $245 million and $182 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had $4.82 billion of total\\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8\\nyears.\\nNote 14 – Income Taxes\\nOur income before (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nDomestic\\n$\\n3,196 \\n$\\n5,524 \\n$\\n(130)\\nNoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest\\n(23)\\n31 \\n125 \\nForeign\\n6,800 \\n8,164 \\n6,348 \\nIncome before income taxes\\n$\\n9,973 \\n$\\n13,719 \\n$\\n6,343 \\n83\\nA (benefit from) provision for income taxes of $(5.00) billion, $1.13 billion and $699 million has been recognized for the years ended December 31,\\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and\\nverifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state\\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\\nassets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax\\nassets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to be realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets\\ngeneration in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\\n84\\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDeferred tax assets:\\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\\n$\\n2,826 \\n$\\n4,486 \\nResearch and development credits\\n1,358 \\n1,184 \\nOther tax credits and attributes\\n827 \\n217 \\nDeferred revenue\\n1,035 \\n751 \\nInventory and warranty reserves\\n1,258 \\n819 \\nStock-based compensation\\n230 \\n185 \\nOperating lease right-of-use liabilities\\n930 \\n554 \\nCapitalized research and development costs\\n1,344 \\n693 \\nDeferred GILTI tax assets\\n760 \\n466 \\nAccruals and others\\n206 \\n178 \\nTotal deferred tax assets\\n10,774 \\n9,533 \\nValuation allowance\\n(892)\\n(7,349)\\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\\n9,882 \\n2,184 \\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n(2,122)\\n(1,178)\\nInvestment in certain financing funds\\n(133)\\n(238)\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n(859)\\n(506)\\nOther\\n(116)\\n(15)\\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\\n(3,230)\\n(1,937)\\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowance\\n$\\n6,652 \\n$\\n247 \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained valuation allowances of $892 million for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be\\nrealized, which primarily included deferred tax assets in the state of California and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net\\ndeferred tax assets decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by\\n$6.14 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due\\nto the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The changes in valuation allowances\\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respective year.\\nAmong our deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses that are not more likely\\nthan not to be realized. The remainder of our foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings\\nin these jurisdictions.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.31 billion of federal and $10.36 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future\\ntaxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2024 for federal and state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial\\nrestrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the\\nInternal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-\\nforwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.10 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of\\n$605 million, and state research and development tax credits of $923 million. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of\\nCalifornia. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2036. However, California research and development\\ntax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\\n85\\nThe local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25%\\nstatutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15% for 2019 through\\n2023. Starting in 2024, Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to 25% statutory corporate income tax rate in China.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs.\\nWe have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest,\\nno deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability\\nassociated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $245 million.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2020\\n$\\n380 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n117 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n(90)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n124 \\nDecember 31, 2021\\n531 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n136 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n(12)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n222 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\n(7)\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n870 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n59 \\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\\n(6)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n255 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\n(4)\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n$\\n1,174 \\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we have accrued $47 million and $31 million,\\nrespectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $901 million, if recognized, would affect our\\neffective tax rate.\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue\\nService (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for\\nfederal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax\\npurposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\\nNote 15 – Commitments and Contingencies\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under\\nthe lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\\n86\\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in\\nthe State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other\\ncosts in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each\\nanniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million\\n“program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to\\na material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses,\\ncosts of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that\\nwe had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2023, we have met and\\nexpect to meet the requirements under this arrangement based on our current and anticipated level of operations. However, if our expectations as to the\\ncosts and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial\\npayments to the SUNY Foundation.\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have\\nbeen constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the\\nend of 2023, which has been achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31,\\n2023, we have met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and\\nthe members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their\\nfiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing\\nand argument are now complete.\\nLitigation Related to Directors’ Compensation\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against\\ncertain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and\\n2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and\\nother relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any\\nwrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of\\nthe agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the\\nsettlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement. The settlement is not expected\\nto have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection\\nwith Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint\\nin the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The\\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated\\nto certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a\\njury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new\\ntrial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On July 14, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.\\n87\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of\\nTesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions\\nconnected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five\\nof those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated\\npurported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then\\nconstituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported\\nstockholder class action.\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that\\nboard members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among\\nother things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\\nparties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 5, 2024.\\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a\\nstock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the\\nstrike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a\\nviolation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges\\nthat it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the\\nstrike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points\\nthat JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have\\nknown would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially\\nreasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that\\nmotion is currently pending before the Court.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a\\nformer contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. A retrial was\\nheld starting on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $3,175,000. As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from\\nan initial $136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On November 2,\\n2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on November 16, 2023, Tesla filed a notice of cross appeal.\\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint\\nagainst Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among\\nothers. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD,\\nalleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was\\nsubject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the\\nCRD’s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On December 18, 2023,\\nTesla filed a motion to stay the case. Separately, on December 26, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to dismiss the case.\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on\\nbehalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and\\nviolation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs\\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases\\nand on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on\\nSeptember 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an\\namended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\\n88\\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other\\nconsumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on\\nSeptember 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later\\nconsolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and\\nother relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class\\naction complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same\\ndefendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to\\namend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a\\npreliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD\\nCapability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the\\naccuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a\\npreliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On\\nOctober 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. On\\nOctober 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego\\nCounty case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California.\\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk\\nand certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about\\nthe Company’s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock\\nbetween February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as\\ndefendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several\\nsimilar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates\\nfederal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid\\nTesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated\\namended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17,\\n2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12,\\n2023, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs have also appealed the court’s arbitration order. Trial is currently set for July 7, 2025.\\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably\\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway\\nTraffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Justice\\n(“DOJ”), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology\\n(e.g., vehicle functionality, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla’s business, its personnel,\\nand related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge\\nno government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any\\nongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our\\nbusiness, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\n89\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during\\nthe second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business\\nand personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and\\nwe are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court\\nfor the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits,\\nthat each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in\\nthese or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations,\\nprospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nLetters of Credit\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $525 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\\nNote 16 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In\\nparticular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into\\nrelated agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits\\ncriterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect\\nthe operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these\\nVIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the\\nagreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of\\nthese VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash\\ndistributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss\\nand tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or\\nthe formula specified in the agreements.\\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as\\noperations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the\\nfund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the\\nfunds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\\n90\\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the\\nconsolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAssets\\n \\n \\nCurrent assets\\n \\n \\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n66 \\n$\\n68 \\nAccounts receivable, net\\n13 \\n22 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n361 \\n274 \\nTotal current assets\\n440 \\n364 \\nSolar energy systems, net\\n3,278 \\n4,060 \\nOther non-current assets\\n369 \\n404 \\nTotal assets\\n$\\n4,087 \\n$\\n4,828 \\nLiabilities\\n \\n \\nCurrent liabilities\\n \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other\\n$\\n67 \\n$\\n69 \\nDeferred revenue\\n6 \\n10 \\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\\n1,564 \\n1,013 \\nTotal current liabilities\\n1,637 \\n1,092 \\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\\n99 \\n149 \\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion\\n2,041 \\n971 \\nOther long-term liabilities\\n— \\n3 \\nTotal liabilities\\n$\\n3,777 \\n$\\n2,215 \\nNote 17 – Related Party Transactions\\nIn relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate\\namount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for\\nadditional taxes owed, if any.\\nTesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and X Corp., in accordance with\\nour Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n91\\nNote 18 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas\\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the\\ndesign, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive\\nsegment is also comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts,\\npaid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and\\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures\\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are\\nrequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial\\nreporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\\naccounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and\\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\\nof unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted\\nan evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report which is included herein.\\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which has\\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n93\\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”)\\nbelieves that it is appropriate for the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) to be applied to the certain\\nexecutive officers of the Company and adopts this Policy to be effective as of the Effective Date.\\n1. Definitions\\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\\na) “Company Group” means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\\nb) “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person who served as an\\nExecutive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation and that was\\nReceived (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer.\\nc) “Effective Date” means November 15, 2023.\\nd) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation Received by a person during\\nthe fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was\\nattained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been Received by such\\nperson had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any\\ntaxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return,\\nwhere the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly\\nfrom the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation\\nthat constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\\nRestatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted,\\nvested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such\\ndocumentation to Nasdaq.\\ne) “Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\\nf)\\n“Executive Officer” means each “executive officer” of the Company (as defined in Rule 10D-1(d) under the\\nExchange Act), which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers\\npursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Both current and former Executive Officers\\nare subject to the Policy in accordance with its terms.\\n1\\ng) “Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or\\nin part from such measures and may consist of GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under\\nRegulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act), (ii) stock price or (iii)\\ntotal shareholder return. Financial Reporting Measures may or may not be filed with the SEC and may be\\npresented outside the Company’s financial statements, such as in Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Conditions and Result of Operations or in the performance graph required under Item 201(e) of\\nRegulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\\nh) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in\\npart upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\\ni)\\n“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months\\nthat is within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the\\nCompany’s fiscal year) immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee\\nof the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not\\nrequired, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a\\nRestatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on if or\\nwhen the Restatement is actually filed.\\nj)\\n“Nasdaq” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.\\nk) “Received”: Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which\\nthe Financial Reporting Measure specified in or otherwise relating to the Incentive-Based Compensation award is\\nattained, even if the grant, certification of achievement, vesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation\\noccurs after the end of that period.\\nl)\\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement required due to the material noncompliance by the Company\\nwith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including (i) to correct an error in previously\\nissued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to\\nas a “Big R” restatement) or (ii) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is not material\\nto the previously issued financial statements but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were\\ncorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a “little r”\\nrestatement). Changes to the Company’s financial statements that do not represent error corrections under the\\nthen-current relevant accounting standards will not constitute Restatements.\\n2\\nm) “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nn) “Subsidiary” means any domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint\\nventure, trust or unincorporated organization “affiliated” with the Company, that is, directly or indirectly, through\\none or more intermediaries, “controlling”, “controlled by” or “under common control with”, the Company.\\n“Control” for this purpose means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of\\nthe management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, contract or\\notherwise.\\n2. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\\nIn the event of a Restatement, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received during the Lookback Period that (a) is\\nthen-outstanding but has not yet been paid shall be automatically and immediately forfeited or (b) has been paid to any\\nperson shall be subject to reasonably prompt repayment to the Company Group in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy.\\nThe Committee must pursue (and shall not have the discretion to waive) the forfeiture and/or repayment of such\\nErroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy, except as provided below. Recovery of any\\nErroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on fraud or misconduct by any person in connection\\nwith the Restatement.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or, if the Committee is not a committee of the Board responsible for the\\nCompany’s executive compensation decisions and composed entirely of independent directors, a majority of the\\nindependent directors serving on the Board) may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and/or recovery of Erroneously\\nAwarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture and/or recovery would be\\nimpracticable due to any of the following circumstances: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example,\\nreasonable legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered\\n(following reasonable attempts by the Company Group to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\ndocumentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to the Nasdaq) or (ii) recovery would likely\\ncause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Company\\nGroup, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C.\\n401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\\n3. Means of Repayment\\nIn the event that the Committee determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\nCommittee shall provide written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the\\nCompany Group for such person, and the person shall satisfy such repayment in a manner and on such terms as required\\nby the Committee, and the Company Group shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any amount owed to\\nthe person by the Company Group, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Company Group to the person, or\\nto take any and all necessary actions to reasonably promptly recoup the repayment amount from the person, in each case,\\nto the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, including without limitation, Section 409A of the U.S.\\n3\\nInternal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance thereunder. If the Committee does not specify a repayment\\ntiming in the written notice described above, the applicable person shall be required to repay the Erroneously Awarded\\nCompensation to the Company Group by wire, cash or cashier’s check no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such\\nnotice.\\n4. No Indemnification\\nNo person shall be indemnified, insured or reimbursed by the Company Group in respect of any loss of compensation by\\nsuch person in accordance with this Policy, nor shall any person receive any advancement of expenses for disputes related\\nto any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, and no person shall be paid or reimbursed by\\nthe Company Group for any premiums paid by such person for any third-party insurance policy covering potential recovery\\nobligations under this Policy.\\n5. Miscellaneous\\nThis Policy generally will be administered and interpreted by the Committee, provided that the Board may, from time to\\ntime, exercise discretion to administer and interpret this Policy, in which case, all references herein to “Committee” shall be\\ndeemed to refer to the Board. Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and\\nbinding on all interested parties. Any discretionary determinations of the Committee under this Policy, if any, need not be\\nuniform with respect to all persons, and may be made selectively amongst persons, whether or not such persons are\\nsimilarly situated.\\nThis Policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\\nProtection Act, as it may be amended from time to time, Rule 10D- 1 under the Exchange Act, and any related rules or\\nregulations promulgated by the SEC or the Nasdaq, including any additional or new requirements that become effective\\nafter the Effective Date which upon effectiveness shall be deemed to automatically amend this Policy to the extent\\nnecessary to comply with such additional or new requirements.\\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision\\nof this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the\\nmaximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the\\nextent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not\\naffect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\\nunder this Policy is not dependent upon the Company Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any\\nrequirements to provide applicable documentation to the Nasdaq.\\nThe rights of the Company Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in\\nlieu of, any rights of recoupment, or remedies or rights other than recoupment, that may be available to the Company\\nGroup pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement or any other policy,\\ncode of\\n4\\nconduct, employee handbook, employment agreement, equity award agreement, or other plan or agreement of the\\nCompany Group.\\n6. Amendment and Termination\\nTo the extent permitted by, and in a manner consistent with applicable law, including SEC and Nasdaq rules, the\\nCommittee may terminate, suspend or amend this Policy at any time in its discretion.\\n7. Successors\\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all persons and their respective beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\\nadministrators or other legal representatives with respect to any Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to or\\nadministered by such persons or entities.\\n8. Agreement to Arbitrate; Governing Law; Venue\\nThis Policy and all rights and obligations hereunder will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Texas law. \\nAny dispute arising from or relating to this Policy shall be subject to binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current\\nStreamlined Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”).
